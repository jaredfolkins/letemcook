# LEMC UI Communication Protocol

This section describes how containers (scripts running inside Docker containers) can communicate with the `yeschef` application to update environment variables, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript content for the user interface.

Communication is achieved by printing specially formatted strings to standard output. The `yeschef` application listens to the container's output stream and parses these commands.

## LEMC Verbs

The following "verbs" (prefixes) can be used with `echo` or `print` statements within your container scripts:

1.  **`lemc.env;`**: Sets an environment variable for the current step with the intent to pass the environment variable to forward for use with the next step.
    *   **Action**: Appends the provided string to the job's environment variables.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.env;MY_VARIABLE=hello world"`

2.  **`lemc.css.buffer;`**: Buffers CSS content.
    *   **Action**: Appends the provided CSS string to the current CSS content for the view. *Behaves like `lemc.css.append;`.*
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.css.buffer;body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }"`

3.  **`lemc.css.trunc;`**: Truncates and replaces CSS content.
    *   **Action**: Clears any existing CSS for the view and replaces it with the provided CSS string.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.css.trunc;.title { color: blue; }"`

4.  **`lemc.css.append;`**: Appends CSS content.
    *   **Action**: Appends the provided CSS string to the current CSS content for the view.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.css.append;p { margin-bottom: 10px; }"`

5.  **`lemc.html.buffer;`**: Buffers HTML content.
    *   **Action**: Appends the provided HTML string to the current HTML content for the view. *Behaves like `lemc.html.append;`.*
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.html.buffer;<h1>Welcome</h1>"`

6.  **`lemc.html.trunc;`**: Truncates and replaces HTML content.
    *   **Action**: Clears any existing HTML for the view and replaces it with the provided HTML string.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.html.trunc;<div>New section</div>"`

7.  **`lemc.html.append;`**: Appends HTML content.
    *   **Action**: Appends the provided HTML string to the current HTML content for the view.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.html.append;<p>Additional details.</p>"`

8.  **`lemc.js.trunc;`**: Truncates and replaces JavaScript content.
    *   **Action**: Clears any existing JavaScript for the view and replaces it with the provided JavaScript string. This new JavaScript will then be executed on the client-side.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.js.trunc;console.log('JavaScript has been reset and executed.');"`

9.  **`lemc.js.exec;`**: Executes JavaScript by replacing content.
    *   **Action**: Clears any existing JavaScript for the view and replaces it with the provided JavaScript string. This new JavaScript will then be executed on the client-side. *Effectively the same as `lemc.js.trunc;` based on current `yeschef/container.go` implementation.*
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.js.exec;alert('This JavaScript was executed!');"`

10.  **`lemc.err;`**: Signals a fatal error and stops the current job.
    *   **Action**: Sends the error message to the UI using `lemc.html.append;`, then appends `job failed` and terminates the job.
    *   **Example**: `echo "lemc.err;something went wrong"`

## Using Verbs

To use these verbs, simply `echo` or `print` (depending on your script's language) the command string. The `yeschef` application will intercept this output.

**Example (shell script):**
```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo "lemc.html.trunc;<h1>My Dynamic Page</h1>"
echo "lemc.css.append;body { background-color: #eee; }"
echo "lemc.js.exec;console.log('Page updated by container.');"
echo "lemc.env;JOB_STATUS=completed"
```

**Example (error handling using `lemc.err`):**
```shell
#!/bin/sh
config="/etc/myapp/config.json"
if [ ! -f "$config" ]; then
  echo "lemc.err;Missing config file: $config"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Suggestion: Helper Functions

To make your agent scripts cleaner and less prone to typos, consider creating helper functions within your scripts or a shared library if your agent environment supports it.

These helper functions would encapsulate the `echo` command and the specific LEMC verb.

**Example (shell script helper functions):**
```shell
#!/bin/sh

# Helper function to truncate HTML
lemc_html_trunc() {
  echo "lemc.html.trunc;$1"
}

# Helper function to append CSS
lemc_css_append() {
  echo "lemc.css.append;$1"
}

# Helper function to execute JS (by truncating and setting new JS)
lemc_js_exec() {
  echo "lemc.js.exec;$1"
}

# Helper function to set an environment variable
lemc_set_env() {
  echo "lemc.env;$1"
}

# --- Usage ---
lemc_html_trunc "<h2>Updated Content</h2><p>This is the new HTML.</p>"
lemc_css_append ".important { font-weight: bold; color: red; }"
lemc_js_exec "document.body.style.filter = 'invert(1)';"
lemc_set_env "LAST_UPDATE=$(date)"

```

### Benefits of Helper Functions:

*   **Readability**: Makes the main part of your script easier to understand.
*   **Maintainability**: If the LEMC verb syntax changes, you only need to update the helper functions.
*   **Reduced Errors**: Less chance of typos in the command prefixes.
*   **Abstraction**: The helper function handles the "how" (the `echo` and prefix), so your main script focuses on "what" (the content).

When a command is sent using these verbs (either directly or via a helper function), the `yeschef` application will:
1.  **Log the raw message**: The original string (e.g., `lemc.html.trunc;<h1>Title</h1>`) is logged by `yeschef`.
2.  **Process the command**: The appropriate action (truncating CSS, appending HTML, etc.) is taken, and the content is streamed to the connected client(s).

This provides a mechanism for both logging the container activity and updating the user interface in real-time.

## Automatically Injected Environment Variables

When a step container starts, `yeschef` supplies a number of environment variables to give the script context about the job being executed. These are in addition to any variables you emit via `lemc.env;` during previous steps. Key variables include:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LEMC_STEP_ID` | Current step number within the recipe. | `1` |
| `LEMC_SCOPE` | `individual` for user‑run jobs or `shared` for shared recipes. | `individual` |
| `LEMC_USER_ID` | Numeric ID of the initiating user. | `101` |
| `LEMC_USERNAME` | Username of the initiating user. | `jdoe` |
| `LEMC_UUID` | UUID of the Cookbook/App context. | `ac72b1e9-0489-4b28-9df5-179c70419203` |
| `LEMC_RECIPE_NAME` | Sanitized name of the recipe. | `my-awesome-recipe` |
| `LEMC_PAGE_ID` | Numerical ID of the Cookbook page. | `3` |
| `LEMC_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` | Base path for constructing download links to files placed in `/lemc/public/`. | `/lemc/locker/uuid/<UUID>/page/<PAGE_ID>/scope/<SCOPE>/filename/` |
| `LEMC_HTML_ID` | Generated ID of the container’s HTML output element. | `uuid-<UUID>-pageid-<PAGE_ID>-scope-<SCOPE>-html` |
| `LEMC_CSS_ID` | Generated ID of the container’s `<style>` tag. | `uuid-<UUID>-pageid-<PAGE_ID>-scope-<SCOPE>-style` |
| `LEMC_JS_ID` | Generated ID of the job’s `<script>` tag. | `uuid-<UUID>-pageid-<PAGE_ID>-scope-<SCOPE>-script` |

Form fields defined in your recipe YAML are also exposed. If you create an input named `My_Param`, the environment variable inside the container becomes `LEMC_FIELD_MY_PARAM` with the supplied value.

## Mounted Directories inside Containers

Scripts can read and write files via directories mounted under `/lemc/` in the container. The exact host paths are prepared by `yeschef`, but conceptually they map as follows:

| Mount Point | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/lemc/public/` | Public per‑job directory. Files here are accessible via URLs built from `LEMC_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL`. |
| `/lemc/private/` | Private per‑job directory for data not exposed via HTTP. |
| `/lemc/global/` | Global directory scoped to the job UUID for shared assets. |
| `/lemc/shared/` | Directory only mounted when running shared recipes, allowing cross-user collaboration. |

These variables and mount points give your script full awareness of its execution context and where it can place artifacts for the UI to display or download.


# Let ’Em Cook (LEMC) Architecture and Workflow

LEMC facilitates the automation of predefined “recipes” (scripts) by running them in containerized steps with live web UI feedback. For a deeper understanding of its core concepts and design philosophy, see [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md). This document details LEMC’s architecture, runtime behavior, and system interactions.

## Overall Architecture of LEMC

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/diag1.png" alt="diagram1" />
</p>

&#x20;*Figure: LEMC overall architecture and component interaction.* 

LEMC’s core is a Go-based server (code-named **YesChef**) that exposes a web UI and orchestrates the execution of recipes. Users interact with LEMC through a browser-based **Web UI** (built with HTMX and Templ) served by the backend. The backend persists data (users, cookbooks, recipes, logs, etc.) in a **SQLite database**, and it leverages the host’s **Docker Daemon** (via Docker’s API socket) to run recipe steps in isolated containers. Each **recipe** consists of one or more **steps**, where each step is a script packaged as a Docker image (containing all its code and dependencies). LEMC is language-agnostic – any language or tool can be used inside steps as long as it can run in a container and print output. A **container registry** (like Docker Hub or a private registry) is used to store and distribute these step images; LEMC will pull the needed image if it’s not already available locally. The web UI and backend communicate in real-time (over WebSockets) so that as containers produce output, the results are immediately pushed to the user’s browser. In essence, the architecture links the **user interface**, the **LEMC server**, the **database**, and **Docker** as an execution sandbox, enabling on-demand automation of tasks.

Key components in this architecture include:

* **Cookbooks and Recipes:** In LEMC, recipes (tasks) are organized into *cookbooks*. A cookbook is a collection of related recipes, and each recipe is defined by one or more step containers to run. The LEMC server stores these definitions in the SQLite DB and presents them in the UI as buttons or actions. Recipes can be executed on demand (by user click) or scheduled to run periodically.
* **YesChef Backend (LEMC Server):** The backend is a Go application (using the Echo framework) that provides a web server and manages job execution. It handles user authentication (an admin account is created on first launch, and additional users can be managed), serves the HTML interface, and implements a WebSocket channel to stream output to the UI. It uses Gorilla WebSocket for real-time updates. The backend also includes a scheduler component (based on go-quartz) to support cron-like scheduling of recipes.
* **Web UI:** LEMC’s front-end is delivered via server-side rendered pages (Templ templates) enhanced with HTMX for dynamic behavior. Users access the UI through a browser. The UI lists available Apps/Cookbooks and their recipes. When a recipe runs, the UI displays live output (text or HTML) streaming from the container. Special LEMC output commands (discussed below) allow rich content like formatted HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to be displayed in the browser in real time.
* **Docker Containers (Recipe Steps):** Each recipe step runs inside a Docker container launched by LEMC. This containerization provides isolation and consistency across environments. For example, one step might be a Python script in a Python image, and the next step could be a Bash script in an Alpine Linux image – LEMC handles running each in the appropriate container, passing data between steps as needed. Docker ensures that each step’s code runs with its required dependencies and does not affect the host system directly (aside from controlled interactions like volume mounts). LEMC relies on Docker’s sandboxing as a primary security mechanism.
* **Persistent Storage:** LEMC uses a local `data/` directory (on the host or container running LEMC) to store its SQLite database and configuration (it auto-initializes this on first run). This storage retains all cookbook definitions, user accounts, execution history, etc., across restarts.

In the architecture diagram above, the **User** triggers a recipe via the browser, causing the **LEMC Server** to retrieve the recipe definition from **SQLite DB**, then instruct the **Docker Daemon** to run the specified container image for each step. If the image isn’t present, Docker will pull it from the **Container Registry** first. As the container runs, the script’s output (stdout) is monitored by the backend; special **LEMC Verbs** printed in the output are intercepted for UI updates or state passing (instead of being shown raw). The backend streams live feedback to the user’s browser (via WebSocket or server-sent events) so the user can see progress. Multiple steps are executed in sequence (each as a fresh container) – after one step finishes, the next container is started, potentially using environment data passed along. The **Scheduler** can also trigger the backend to start a recipe at predetermined times (dotted line in the diagram). Throughout execution, any files that the script writes to a special shared volume (e.g. `/lemc/public`) will be accessible to the LEMC server for download links (this is shown as the **Bind-Mounted Volume** for outputs) – for example, a script can drop a report file which the UI can present as a downloadable link.

## Runtime Behavior and Lifecycle of a Recipe Execution

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/diag2.png" alt="diagram2" height="600" />
</p>

&#x20;*Figure: LEMC recipe execution flow (lifecycle of a run).* 

LEMC’s runtime behavior follows a clear sequence of events from the moment a recipe is invoked to the completion of all its steps. The system manages the lifecycle of each “job” (recipe run) and maintains state between steps as needed. The diagram below illustrates the typical flow of execution for a recipe:

When a recipe is **triggered** – either by a user clicking its run button in the UI, or by an automated schedule – the LEMC backend creates a new job and begins executing the recipe’s steps. If the recipe has multiple steps, they will run **sequentially** (one container after another). The execution lifecycle can be described in stages:

1. **Trigger Phase:** A recipe run can start via manual or scheduled trigger. In a manual case, a user selects an App/page in the web UI and clicks on a recipe’s button to run it, which sends an HTTP request to the server to start the job. In a scheduled case, the built-in scheduler (go-quartz) will automatically initiate the job at the configured time (as if a “virtual click” happened). In both cases, the backend transitions from an idle state to a “recipe running” state for that job.
2. **Container Launch (Step 1):** The backend looks up the first step of the recipe to determine which Docker image to use and any parameters (like a timeout or input values). It then instructs the Docker daemon to launch a new container for this step. LEMC automatically injects several **environment variables** into the container before it starts – these include context like the step number, the user who triggered it, the recipe name, and a unique job ID, among others. This provides the script with context and a channel to communicate results (for example, knowing `LEMC_HTML_ID` or base URLs for output files). If this is the first step of a recipe, environment variables may include defaults or initial context; if it’s a subsequent step, it will also include any variables set by previous steps (explained below). The Docker container then executes the script (the container’s `CMD` runs the script file).
3. **Live Execution and Output Streaming:** As the script inside the container runs, it typically prints output to standard output (stdout). The LEMC backend attaches to the container’s output stream (using Docker APIs) and **parses each line** in real-time. **Normal output lines** (without the special prefix) can be forwarded directly to the UI (often as plain text or log output), while lines beginning with `lemc.` are treated as **LEMC commands**:

    * `lemc.html.buffer; ...`, `lemc.html.append;` – these tell LEMC to collect HTML fragments and then append them to the web UI. This allows scripts to build rich HTML output (tables, formatted text, etc.) that appears in the user’s browser.
    * `lemc.css.append; ...` or `lemc.css.trunc; ...` – similar for injecting CSS styles into the page.
    * `lemc.js.exec; ...` – for executing JavaScript in the client (if needed for interactive results).
    * `lemc.env;KEY=value` – this is critical for multi-step recipes: it tells LEMC to set an environment variable `KEY=value` that will persist into the **next step’s** container environment. This is how one step can pass data to subsequent steps.

   The YesChef backend processes these verbs on the fly. For example, if a script prints `lemc.env;STATUS=ok`, the backend will record that `STATUS` should be exported in the environment for the next container before it starts. If the script prints `lemc.html.buffer;<p>Hello</p>`, the backend buffers that HTML snippet and, upon receiving a corresponding `lemc.html.append;` or end-of-step, pushes it to the UI to be rendered. Throughout the step’s execution, LEMC streams output and updates to the user’s browser **in real time**. The UI will update live, showing text logs or rendered HTML content as directed by the script. This is achieved via a WebSocket connection: the backend sends messages to the front-end whenever there’s new output (or uses HTMX triggers for partial updates).
4. **Step Completion and Transition:** When the script in the container finishes (the process exits), Docker reports the container’s exit status to the LEMC backend. LEMC marks this step as completed (and may log the outcome). If the recipe has another step, the system proceeds to launch the **next container**:

    * Before launching the next step, LEMC prepares its environment. All the `lemc.env` variables that were collected from the previous step’s output are now injected into the next container’s env, so the next script can directly use those values. This mechanism allows state to carry over (for example, Step 1 might produce an API token or compute a value that Step 2 needs).
    * The Docker daemon is then instructed to run the next step’s image, just like before. LEMC ensures (again) that the correct image version is present (pulling from the registry if needed, which typically would have been done upfront on first use).
    * The output of Step 2 is streamed in the same fashion, and any further `lemc.env` from step 2 would go to step 3, and so on.
5. **Recipe Completion:** This loop continues until all defined steps in the recipe have been executed. At that point, the backend marks the entire recipe run as **completed**. Final status (success/failure per step) is recorded, and the UI may display a “completed” message or enable any post-run options (like downloading files). All the live output that was streamed remains visible in the UI, typically appended in the recipe’s output panel for the user to review. If the recipe was triggered manually, the user sees the result immediately; if it was scheduled and ran in the background, a user can likely view the output/logs after the fact by accessing the App and recipe page.
6. **Result Persistence:** By default, anything printed to the UI (via LEMC verbs or plain output) is captured for the session but not permanently stored in the UI after reload (though logs may be stored in the DB or files). However, if a script needs to deliver a file or artifact, it can place it in the shared **output volume**. LEMC mounts a host directory into each container at a path (like `/lemc/public/`), and any file dropped there will be accessible via an HTTP URL. For instance, a script might create `/lemc/public/report.pdf`; the backend serves this file through a special download route (with a URL containing the cookbook UUID, page, scope, and filename). The user can then download it from the UI. This mechanism enables passing larger results or files out of the container sandbox in a controlled way.

Throughout the runtime, LEMC manages the **state** of the job: it knows which step is currently running and what environment context has been accumulated. If an error occurs (e.g., a container exits with a non-zero status), LEMC would typically stop the remaining steps (unless configured otherwise) and mark the job as failed, presenting the error in the UI. The isolation provided by Docker means that each step’s execution environment is fresh – once a container exits, any filesystem changes inside it (aside from the mounted output folder) are discarded, preventing side effects on subsequent runs. This ensures consistent behavior run-to-run, and if a recipe needs to maintain state across runs, it would do so via external systems or by writing to the mounted volume or database explicitly.

## Interactions with the Host System and External Tools

While most of LEMC’s logic operates at an application level, it interacts with the host operating system and external services in several important ways, as shown in the architecture. Key host/external interactions include:

* **Docker Daemon (Containers on Host):** LEMC requires access to a Docker service on the host machine to run recipe steps. In a typical installation, the LEMC backend has the Docker UNIX socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) mounted or accessible. By sending commands to this socket (using Docker’s Go SDK or HTTP API), LEMC asks the host’s Docker daemon to perform actions like pulling images, creating containers, starting/stopping containers, and attaching to container logs. This means the LEMC process itself doesn’t spawn system processes directly for user scripts – it delegates to Docker, which in turn creates isolated container processes on the host OS. The benefit is that the actual script execution is confined within Docker’s control (namespaces, cgroups, etc.), offering a layer of isolation from the host. The trade-off is that LEMC inherently trusts the Docker daemon; access to the Docker socket is a powerful capability (effectively root-equivalent on the host), so LEMC is designed for environments where authorized users are trusted or Docker is properly sandboxed. **Security:** Docker acts as the sandbox. LEMC’s documentation notes that it “relies on Docker container isolation as the primary sandboxing mechanism”. It doesn’t run untrusted code directly on the host – only inside containers. Thus, host security is largely delegated to Docker’s security model. Administrators should control who can define or execute recipes, since those users ultimately run code on the host via Docker.
* **File System and Volume Mounts:** The LEMC server itself uses the host file system to store its data. On first run, LEMC initializes a `data/` directory (in the working directory or a configured path), creates a SQLite database file, and also generates a `.env` file with default configs. All user-created content like cookbook definitions, user accounts, and job logs are stored in the database or in this directory. Additionally, as described, LEMC sets up a **bind mount** into each container for output files. By default, a directory (often under `data/` or a subpath like `data/public/`) is mounted into the container at `/lemc/public`. This allows two-way file exchange: the container can write files that the host (and LEMC server) can read, and theoretically the server could also provide input files via this mount. After execution, any files left in that folder are served by the LEMC backend through an HTTP endpoint (the `LEMC_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` env variable gives the route structure). This mechanism is the primary means for a container to have side effects on the host (writing output files). Aside from this mounted folder and the Docker socket, containers are not given arbitrary host access – they run with whatever filesystem is in their image plus the mount. The LEMC process itself may also write logs to files or stdout for its own logging, but operationally most data is in the SQLite DB.
* **Networking and Registry Access:** To fetch container images, the Docker daemon may reach out to external container registries. For example, if a recipe’s Docker image is `dockerhub.com/myrepo/tool:latest` and it’s not already cached, Docker will perform an image pull from the internet. LEMC facilitates this by naming the image and letting Docker handle the download. In the Quick Start example, an image `lemc-my-first-recipe:latest` is built locally, but for sharing, users are encouraged to push images to a registry and then reference them by name. Thus, one external interaction is **Docker Hub/Registry** access. LEMC itself doesn’t directly contact the registry; it relies on Docker to do so when needed. In terms of other network interactions: the LEMC web server listens on a port (default `5362`) for user connections, and it upgrades some connections to WebSockets for live data. It does not, by default, make other outbound network calls – any integration with external systems would happen from within the user’s scripts (inside containers). For instance, if a recipe step calls an API or SSH to a server, that traffic originates from the container, not the LEMC host process.
* **System Resources and Calls:** Under the hood, running a container involves system calls to create processes, configure namespaces, etc., but those are handled by the Docker engine. LEMC’s backend process is mostly an I/O-bound web app orchestrator. It does schedule jobs (which internally might use goroutines/timers via go-quartz) but does not create OS-level cron jobs or similar – scheduling is in-process via the library. The backend might invoke some OS commands indirectly (for example, if using Docker CLI or performing migrations via Goose), but as per the tech stack, most operations use libraries (Docker SDK, Goose for DB migrations) that handle the system interactions. In *Docker Compose* mode, LEMC itself runs in a Docker container (with the socket and data directory mounted), so from the host’s perspective, it’s just another container.
* **External Tools/Systems:** Aside from Docker, DB, and the registry, LEMC doesn’t inherently integrate with other external tools. However, recipes authored by users could invoke anything (Terraform, Ansible, cloud CLIs, etc.) inside their containers. For example, a recipe could run a Terraform container to apply infrastructure changes – the LEMC framework treats it as just another step. The results (terraform plan output, etc.) would be streamed back via LEMC’s channels. In this way, LEMC can function similarly to CI/CD or job-runner systems, but with a focus on interactive, on-demand usage.

In summary, LEMC’s interaction with the host is centered on Docker and file access through controlled channels. It uses Docker to isolate execution, uses the host file system to persist state (DB, env, output files), and uses network connectivity for user access and image distribution. **Host requirements:** To run LEMC, the host needs Docker (with permission for LEMC to access it) and the ability to open the web service port. Because of these interactions, running LEMC typically requires admin/root privileges (for Docker) at least at setup, and it’s geared toward usage in a trusted environment (small team or single user).

## User Configuration and Invocation of LEMC

<p align="center">
  <img src="../media/diag3.png" alt="diagram3" />
</p>

&#x20;*Figure: Workflow for configuring and invoking a LEMC recipe (from development to execution).*

From a user or developer’s perspective, the general workflow for utilizing LEMC involves:
1.  **Scripting & Containerization:** Develop a script and package it into a Docker image with all its dependencies. This image becomes the executable unit for a recipe step.
2.  **Recipe Definition in LEMC:** Within the LEMC UI, define this Docker image as a step within a new or existing recipe. This includes specifying the image name, and any parameters like timeouts.
3.  **App Creation & Execution:** Instantiate the cookbook (containing the recipe) as an App in LEMC. Then, run the recipe via the App's UI.

This process allows developers to transform standalone scripts into easily executable and shareable automated tasks with UI feedback.

For a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on creating and running your first recipe, please see the [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) guide.

**References:** The above explanations are based on the LEMC documentation and repository, which describe its container-based execution model, real-time UI feedback via special printed commands, environment variable propagation between steps, and usage of Docker and scheduling. The Quick Start guide in the documentation illustrates how a user would create and run a recipe through LEMC’s UI, which aligns with the workflow described above. LEMC’s architecture is designed to be minimal yet powerful, leveraging existing tools (Docker, web tech, databases) to enable developers to automate tasks easily and safely. The diagrams and steps provided give a comprehensive view of how LEMC works internally and how one would interact with it to get things cooking.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Automation Focus:** LEMC automates script execution ("recipes") in containerized environments.
*   **Developer-Centric:** Designed for developers to manage their own operational tasks ("Ops your Devs").
*   **UI Feedback:** Scripts communicate with a web UI in real-time using "LEMC verbs."
*   **Language Agnostic:** Run scripts in any language that can be containerized.
*   **Core Workflow:** Package scripts in Docker, define them as recipe steps in LEMC, and run via UI or schedule.

## Core Concept

LEMC (Let'em Cook) is an open-source tool for automating and executing predefined "recipes" (scripts) on demand, with results streamed live to a web interface, empowering developers to perform operational tasks. For a deeper understanding of the design principles and motivations behind LEMC, please see [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md).

## Key Components

*   **Cookbooks**: Collections of related recipes (tasks).
*   **Recipes**: A defined sequence of one or more script-based steps to accomplish a specific task. Presented as runnable actions in the UI.
*   **Steps**: Individual scripts within a recipe. LEMC is language-agnostic; steps can be written in Bash, Python, Go, etc.

## Execution Environment

*   **Containerized**: Recipes run in Docker containers, ensuring consistent and isolated execution. Each recipe step typically uses a Docker image containing its code and dependencies.
*   **Language-Agnostic**: Scripts can be written in any language that can run in a container and print to standard output.

## Real-Time UI Communication (LEMC Verbs)

Scripts communicate with the LEMC UI by printing specially formatted strings (verbs) to standard output. The `yeschef` application (LEMC's backend) parses these commands to dynamically update the UI with HTML, CSS, or execute JavaScript, and to pass environment variables between steps.

For a detailed reference of all available LEMC Verbs and examples of their usage, including helper functions, please see [SCRIPT_UI_COMMUNICATION.md](SCRIPT_UI_COMMUNICATION.md).

**Brief Overview of Verb Categories:**
*   **`lemc.env;KEY=value`**: Sets environment variables for subsequent steps.
*   **`lemc.css.*`**: Verbs to manage CSS (append, truncate).
*   **`lemc.html.*`**: Verbs to manage HTML content (append, truncate).
*   **`lemc.js.*`**: Verbs to manage and execute JavaScript (truncate, execute).

**Note on `lemc.env`:** The LEMC backend collects `KEY=value` pairs from `lemc.env` outputs. These are then injected as environment variables into the container for the *next* step of the recipe.

## Scheduling

*   Recipes can be scheduled to run periodically (cron-like functionality) via the go-quartz library.
*   This allows for managed, recurring tasks with UI feedback and logging.

## Philosophy
*(This section has been integrated into the Core Concept and [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md))*

## Tech Stack Highlights

*   **Backend**: Go (Golang) with the Echo web framework.
*   **Database**: SQLite.
*   **Frontend**: Server-side templating (Templ) with HTMX for interactivity.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
*   **Containerization**: Docker.

## Security

*   Relies on Docker container isolation as the primary sandboxing mechanism.
*   Lightweight user/permission model suitable for small teams.
*   Admin account created on first launch; admin can manage users.
Access to the Docker socket is a requirement.

This feature set allows for flexible and powerful automation directly from scripts, with real-time updates to a web interface, making operational tasks more accessible and manageable for development teams.

## Automatically Injected Environment Variables

LEMC injects several environment variables into the step's container for context. Key variables include:

| Variable                      | Description                                                                                                | Example Value / Format                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `LEMC_STEP_ID`                | Current step number in the recipe.                                                                         | `1`, `2`                                    |
| `LEMC_SCOPE`                  | Job scope: "individual" (user-run) or "shared".                                                          | `individual`                                |
| `LEMC_USER_ID`                | Numerical ID of the initiating user.                                                                       | `101`                                       |
| `LEMC_USERNAME`               | Username of the initiating user.                                                                           | `jdoe`                                      |
| `LEMC_UUID`                   | UUID of the parent Cookbook/App.                                                                           | `ac72b1e9-0489-4b28-9df5-179c70419203`      |
| `LEMC_RECIPE_NAME`            | Name of the current recipe (sanitized).                                                                    | `my-awesome-recipe`                         |
| `LEMC_PAGE_ID`                | Numerical ID of the Cookbook page for the recipe.                                                          | `3`                                         |
| `LEMC_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` | Base path for constructing download links. Files placed by a script into its `/lemc/public/` mounted directory are automatically made accessible via HTTP GET requests to a URL formed by this base path followed by the filename. The path structure typically includes context like UUID, page ID, and scope, and ends with `/filename/`. | `/lemc/locker/uuid/<UUID>/page/<PAGE_ID>/scope/<SCOPE>/filename/` |
| `LEMC_HTML_ID`                | Dynamically generated ID for the job's HTML output container in the UI.                                     | `uuid-JOB_UUID-pageid-PAGE_ID-scope-SCOPE-html` |
| `LEMC_CSS_ID`                 | Dynamically generated ID for the job's CSS `<style>` tag.                                                   | `uuid-JOB_UUID-pageid-PAGE_ID-scope-SCOPE-style` |
| `LEMC_JS_ID`                  | Dynamically generated ID for the job's JavaScript `<script>` area.                                          | `uuid-JOB_UUID-pageid-PAGE_ID-scope-SCOPE-script` |

**Form-Derived Variables**: For each form field defined in a recipe (e.g., a field named `My_Param` or `my-parameter` in the YAML), LEMC creates an environment variable. The HTML form input will be named `LEMC_FIELD_FORM_NAME_HERE` (where `FORM_NAME_HERE` is derived from your YAML definition, with spaces and hyphens converted to underscores, e.g., `LEMC_FIELD_My_Param` or `LEMC_FIELD_my_parameter`). In the container, the environment variable name will **retain the `LEMC_FIELD_` prefix**, and the part of the name following the prefix (derived from the YAML definition) will be **converted to uppercase**.
    *   Example: If YAML field is `My_Param` (HTML form name `LEMC_FIELD_My_Param`), the resulting env var in the container is `LEMC_FIELD_MY_PARAM=value`.
    *   Example: If YAML field is `my_lower_param` (HTML form name `LEMC_FIELD_my_lower_param`), env var is `LEMC_FIELD_MY_LOWER_PARAM=value`.
    *   Example: If YAML field is `my-mixed-Param` (HTML form name `LEMC_FIELD_my_mixed_Param`), env var is `LEMC_FIELD_MY_MIXED_PARAM=value`.

**Note on `LEMC_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL`**: To form a complete URL, append the specific filename directly after this base path. The path resolves to a file within the job's public artifact store. For example, if `LEMC_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` is `/lemc/locker/uuid/abc/page/1/scope/individual/filename/` and your file is `report.txt`, the full path used in a link would be `/lemc/locker/uuid/abc/page/1/scope/individual/filename/report.txt`.

These variables provide scripts with essential runtime information.

## Quick Start: Creating and Using a Local Script with Docker

For a step-by-step guide on creating your first recipe, including writing a script, containerizing it with Docker, and running it in LEMC, please refer to the [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) tutorial.

## Mounted File System in Containers

LEMC mounts several host directories into the container under `/lemc/` to allow scripts to access and store data. Standard mount points include:

| Mount Point      | Host Source (Conceptual)                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/lemc/public/`  | User-specific public directory (`cf.BindPerUserPublicDir`)          | For user-specific files, potentially web-accessible if served.                                                                                                                                   |
| `/lemc/private/` | User-specific private directory (`cf.BindPerUserPrivateDir`)        | For user-specific private files, not directly served.                                                                                                                                            |
| `/lemc/global/`  | UUID-specific 'locker' context directory (`cf.BindGlobalDir`)       | Global within `LEMC_UUID` scope (Cookbook/App 'locker'). For shared utilities/data relevant to that UUID's context.                                                                               |
| `/lemc/shared/`  | Common directory for shared recipes (`cf.BindSharedDir`)            | Mounted for "shared" recipes. For resources accessible to any job running that specific shared recipe.                                                                                           |

These mounts provide structured file system interaction for containerized scripts.
# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Go (version specified in `.go-version`)
*   Docker & Docker Compose (Optional, for running via container)
*   Access to a Docker daemon socket (required for recipe execution, default: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`)

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaredfolkins/letemcook.git
    cd letemcook
    ```

2.  **Build the binary (Required for Manual / Live Reload):**
    ```bash
    go build -o ./tmp/lemc ./main.go
    ```

#### Manual Execution

*   Run the compiled binary directly:
    ```bash
    ./tmp/lemc
    ```
*   On the first run, LEMC will initialize the `data/` directory, create `data/.env`, run migrations, and start the server (default: `http://localhost:5362`).

#### Development (Live Reload)

*   Ensure you have `air` installed (`go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest`).
*   Make sure the binary is built (step 2 above).
*   Run `air` in the project root:
    ```bash
    air
    ```
*   `air` will monitor your Go files and automatically rebuild and restart the application on changes.

#### Docker Compose

*   Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
*   This uses the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
*   The `data` directory and the Docker socket are automatically mounted into the container.

#### Initial Setup (After starting LEMC using any method)

*   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5362`.
*   You will be redirected to the `/setup` page to create the initial administrator account.

## Quick Start: Your First Recipe 🔥

This guide will walk you through creating a simple "Hello World" recipe that also displays the current date from within its container.

### 1. Create Your Script (`my_recipe.sh`)

Create a file named `my_recipe.sh` in a new directory (e.g., `my-first-recipe/`) with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "lemc.html.buffer; <h1>Hello from my LEMC recipe!</h1>"
echo "lemc.html.buffer; <p>The current date and time in the container is: <strong>$(date)</strong></p>"
echo "lemc.html.append;"
```

This script uses special `lemc.` prefixed commands:
*   `lemc.html.buffer; <HTML_CONTENT>`: Streams the `<HTML_CONTENT>` to the LEMC UI.
*   `lemc.html.append;`: Signals that a block of HTML has been completely sent and can be appended to the display.

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x my_recipe.sh
```

### 2. Create a Dockerfile

In the same `my-first-recipe/` directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Copy the script into the image
COPY my_recipe.sh /app/my_recipe.sh

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Make the script executable (though already done, good practice in Dockerfile)
RUN chmod +x my_recipe.sh

# Command to run when the container starts
CMD ["/app/my_recipe.sh"]
```

This `Dockerfile` does the following:
*   Uses the lightweight `alpine:latest` base image.
*   Copies your `my_recipe.sh` script into the `/app/` directory in the image.
*   Sets `/app/` as the working directory.
*   Ensures the script is executable.
*   Specifies `my_recipe.sh` as the command to run when the container starts.

### 3. Build Your Docker Image

Navigate into your `my-first-recipe/` directory in the terminal and run the following command to build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t lemc-my-first-recipe:latest .
```
This command builds an image and tags it as `lemc-my-first-recipe:latest`. It's a good practice to prefix your LEMC-related images with `lemc-` for easier identification.

**(Optional but Recommended for Sharing/Production)**
If you plan to use a Docker registry (like Docker Hub, GitLab Container Registry, etc.), you should tag and push your image:
```bash
# Tag the image with your registry, e.g., example.com/your-repo/
docker tag lemc-my-first-recipe:latest example.com/your-username/lemc-my-first-recipe:latest

# Push the image to the registry
docker push example.com/your-username/lemc-my-first-recipe:latest
```
Replace `example.com/your-username/` with your actual registry path and username/namespace.

### 4. Define Your Recipe in a LEMC Cookbook

1.  **Open LEMC:** Navigate to your LEMC instance in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5362`).
2.  **Go to Cookbooks:** Find the "Cookbooks" section in the navigation.
3.  **Create or Select a Cookbook:**
    *   If you don't have a cookbook, create a new one (e.g., "My Test Cookbook"). Follow the UI prompts, which may involve clicking a "+" symbol or similar action to create a new cookbook.
    *   Otherwise, select an existing cookbook to which you want to add your new recipe.
4.  **Add Your New Recipe to the Cookbook:**
    *   Within the selected cookbook's interface, find the option to "Add New Recipe" or similar.
    *   **Recipe-Level Information:**
        *   **Recipe Name:** Give your recipe a unique name within the cookbook (e.g., "My Hello World").
        *   **Description:** (Optional) Add a short description of what your recipe does.
    *   **Details for the First Step (as recipes consist of one or more steps):**
        *   **Image Name:** This is the Docker image the step will run (e.g., `lemc-my-first-recipe:latest` if built locally, or `example.com/your-username/lemc-my-first-recipe:latest` if pushed to a registry). LEMC will use the Docker daemon to find/pull this image. Consider prefixing your LEMC image names with `lemc-` for better organization.
        *   **Timeout:** Specify how long this step is allowed to run (e.g., `1.minute`).
        *   **`do` field:** For this initial step, set this to `now`. This ensures the step executes when the recipe is manually triggered from an App.
    *   Leave other fields (such as those for form inputs or additional steps) at their default values for this simple example.
5.  **Save the Recipe.** This action saves the recipe definition within the cookbook. Ensure any overall cookbook changes are also saved if required by the UI.

### 5. Create a LEMC App from Your Cookbook

Now that your recipe is defined in a cookbook, you need to create an "App." An App is an instance of a cookbook, allowing you to run its recipes.

1.  **Go to Apps:** In the LEMC navigation bar, click on "Apps."
2.  **Initiate New App Creation:** On the "Apps" page, click the "+" button (as seen in the UI screenshot) to start creating a new App.
3.  **Configure the App:**
    *   **App Name:** Give your App a descriptive name (e.g., "My First Test App").
    *   **Select Cookbook:** From the available options, choose the cookbook that contains the "My Hello World" recipe you just defined.
    *   Fill in any other required App-specific details as prompted.
4.  **Save the App.** After saving, you should see your new App listed on the "Apps" page.

### 6. Run Your Recipe via the App!

*   **Open Your App:** From the "Apps" page, find your newly created App (e.g., "My First Test App"). Click on its name or the associated "App" button to open its interface.
*   **Navigate to the Correct Page/Tab:** Within the App's interface, you will see different pages or tabs (e.g., "Hello World Page," "Kitchen Sink," as shown in your screenshot). Click on the page/tab that contains the recipe you want to run. For this Quick Start, this would be the page where you expect your "My Hello World" recipe to be.
*   **Locate and Execute Your Recipe:** On the correct page, find your "My Hello World" recipe. It will likely be represented by a button labeled with the recipe name (e.g., a "hello world" button as shown in the screenshot under a recipe description like "basic hello world lemc example"). Click this button to execute the recipe.
*   LEMC will now pull the Docker image (if it's not already available locally and a full registry path was provided) and then execute the container.
*   You should see the output ("Hello from my LEMC recipe!" and the current date/time) streamed directly to the UI within the App's context.

Congratulations! You've defined a recipe within a cookbook, created an App to instance that cookbook, and successfully run your first LEMC recipe.

# Let'em Cook (LEMC) – Overview and Design

## Executive Summary

LEMC (Let'em Cook) is an open-source tool enabling developers to automate and execute scripts ("recipes") with real-time web UI feedback. Its core philosophy is **developer-centric operations** ("Ops your Devs"), empowering teams to manage their own operational tasks directly. Key principles include:

*   **Simplicity & Script-First:** Prioritizes plain scripts (Bash, Python, etc.) over complex DSLs or UIs, aligning with rapid development and AI-assisted coding.
*   **Containerization for Consistency:** Leverages Docker to ensure recipes run reliably in isolated, reproducible environments.
*   **Accessibility:** Makes operational tasks accessible via a simple web interface, removing silos and enabling quicker execution of common procedures.
*   **Empowerment:** Follows the "You build it, you run it" mantra, encouraging developers to own the full lifecycle of their services, including operational aspects.

This document explores the design choices, influences, and the cultural context LEMC aims to serve.

**Let'em Cook (LEMC)** is an open-source tool that lets developers automate and execute predefined "recipes" (scripts) on demand, with results streamed live to a web interface. It aims to "Ops your Devs," meaning it empowers developers to perform operational tasks themselves, rather than relying on a separate DevOps team. LEMC addresses the scenario where important scripts or glue code are siloed with individual engineers or running ad-hoc on someone's machine. By packaging such scripts into containers and providing a UI to run them, LEMC makes these tasks accessible to the whole team. The core idea is to allow even non-specialist team members – potentially even a manager or customer – to click a button and "just do the thing" that a script would do, in a safe, repeatable way.

## Philosophical Underpinnings of Core Features

LEMC's architecture is a direct reflection of its philosophy. Instead of detailing each feature here (see [Key Components](FEATURES.md#key-components) and [Execution Environment](FEATURES.md#execution-environment) for that), this section explains the *why* behind key design choices:

*   **Cookbooks and Recipes:** The organization into cookbooks and recipes (see [Key Components](FEATURES.md#key-components) for details) is designed for clarity and reusability, allowing teams to build a library of automated tasks. The lightweight permission model supports this by enabling controlled sharing.
*   **Script-Based Steps:** The choice of plain scripts as the foundation for recipe steps (detailed in [Execution Environment](FEATURES.md#execution-environment)) is central to LEMC. This "language-first" approach maximizes developer familiarity, flexibility, and allows easy integration of existing automation scripts with minimal changes. It avoids vendor lock-in to a specific DSL and embraces the power of general-purpose programming languages.
*   **Containerized Execution:** Using Docker for execution (see [Execution Environment](FEATURES.md#execution-environment) for details) provides critical benefits: **consistency** (eliminating "works on my machine" issues), **isolation** (preventing interference between tasks or with the host), and **dependency management** (packaging all necessary tools within the image). This aligns with modern DevOps best practices.
*   **Real-Time Feedback via Web UI:** The verb-based system for real-time UI updates (see [Real-Time UI Communication (LEMC Verbs)](FEATURES.md#real-time-ui-communication-lemc-verbs) for details) is designed to provide immediate visibility into script execution. This transparency is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and building user confidence, transforming scripts from black boxes into interactive processes.
*   **Scheduling:** The inclusion of scheduling capabilities (see [Scheduling](FEATURES.md#scheduling) for details) extends LEMC from on-demand execution to proactive, automated maintenance and operational tasks, replacing potentially fragile cron jobs with managed, observable processes.
*   **Tech Stack Choices:** The Go backend, SQLite database, and HTMX frontend (see [Tech Stack Highlights](FEATURES.md#tech-stack-highlights) for details) were chosen for **simplicity, performance, and ease of deployment**. The goal was a self-contained system that is easy to run and maintain, even for small teams.

## Security Philosophy

LEMC's security model is intentionally **lightweight and pragmatic**, designed for trusted environments like internal development teams. The core tenets are:

*   **Container Isolation as Primary Defense:** The primary security mechanism is Docker container isolation (see [Security](FEATURES.md#security) for details). This sandboxing is leveraged to confine script execution and limit potential impact on the host system or other operations. This approach assumes that access to LEMC and its underlying Docker socket is already controlled.
*   **Simplified User Management:** The user model (admin creation on first launch, basic user management) is designed for ease of use in small to medium-sized teams where complex enterprise-grade RBAC would be overkill. (Details in [Security](FEATURES.md#security)).
*   **Trust in Developer-Defined Recipes:** LEMC operates on the principle that recipes are created or vetted by the team. The focus is on providing a safe *execution environment* for these trusted scripts, rather than on policing the scripts themselves.

This philosophy prioritizes developer agility and self-service within a trusted context, relying on established container security features.

## "Own Your Ops" Philosophy

LEMC's architecture (simple scripts, containers, minimal config) is meant to flatten this – ideally, the same developers writing application code can also write and run the ops recipes, keeping the loop tight. It's inspired by the idea that in modern teams (especially with AI assistance accelerating coding), a small team can ship faster if they handle their own operational needs. This directly echoes the DevOps mantra "**You build it, you run it**," famously advocated by Amazon's CTO Werner Vogels in 2006. By integrating operations into the development workflow (in this case, via a handy internal tool), LEMC tries to reduce friction and eliminate the scenario of throwing code "over the wall" to ops teams.

## Key Influences and Design Precedents

LEMC builds upon established concepts in system design, automation, and software practices. Understanding these influences provides context for its design choices.

### 1. Job Scheduling & Automation (Cron, CI/CD, Runbook Automation)

*   **Core Idea:** Automating predefined tasks is a foundational concept, from Unix `cron` (1975) for scheduled jobs to modern CI/CD systems (like Jenkins) for event-driven pipelines.
*   **LEMC's Angle:** Provides a user-friendly UI for on-demand and scheduled execution of containerized scripts, akin to how Jenkins offers a "Build Now" button or Rundeck provides self-service runbook automation. It simplifies the "just run my script" need with modern tooling.

### 2. Isolation & Containerization (Chroot, Docker)

*   **Core Idea:** Running processes in isolated, reproducible environments has evolved from `chroot` (1979) and FreeBSD Jails to modern OS-level virtualization like Docker (2013).
*   **LEMC's Angle:** Fully embraces Docker to package recipes with their dependencies. This ensures scripts run consistently and safely, isolated from the host and each other, leveraging decades of OS-level isolation advancements.

### 3. Developer-Centric Operations (DevOps, IaC)

*   **Core Idea:** The DevOps movement, particularly the "You build it, you run it" principle, encourages developers to take operational responsibility. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (like Chef, with its "cookbooks" and "recipes") allow ops tasks to be codified.
*   **LEMC's Angle:** Directly embodies this by enabling developers to write, manage, and execute their own ops scripts. It can be seen as "Operations as Micro-Code," using familiar terminology but for smaller, self-contained tasks.

### 4. Real-time Feedback & Interaction (Actor Model, Live Logging)

*   **Core Idea:** Systems providing real-time insight (e.g., live log streaming via `tail -f`, Jupyter Notebooks for interactive output) enhance usability. The Actor Model (1973) provides a conceptual basis for isolated components communicating via messages.
*   **LEMC's Angle:** Uses a verb-based system over WebSockets to stream HTML, CSS, and JS from running scripts to the UI. This provides live, rich feedback, making script execution transparent and interactive, conceptually similar to an actor sending status messages.

These historical and conceptual pillars are synthesized in LEMC to create a pragmatic tool for modern development teams.

# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Comprehensive Reference

## Introduction

**Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. It helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs by providing:

* **Pre-built integrations:** A growing list of integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
* **Flexibility:** The ability to switch between LLM providers and vendors
* **Security best practices:** Guidance for securing your data within your infrastructure

### General architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

* **MCP Hosts:** Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
* **MCP Clients:** Protocol client connectors that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
* **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
* **Local Data Sources:** Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
* **Remote Services:** External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

In MCP, hosts run *clients* that connect to *servers*. Servers expose capabilities (data access, tools, etc.) and clients enable AI models to use those capabilities. This separation allows any AI application (host) to use any MCP server integration.

### Why MCP?

**For AI application users:** MCP means your AI applications can access the information and tools you work with every day, making them much more helpful. Rather than AI being limited to what it already knows, it can now understand your specific documents, data, and work context. For example, using MCP servers an AI assistant can access your personal documents from Google Drive or data about your codebase from GitHub, providing more personalized assistance. Imagine asking an AI assistant: *“Summarize last week’s team meeting notes and schedule follow-ups.”* With MCP, the assistant could: (1) connect to Google Drive via an MCP server to read meeting notes, (2) figure out follow-ups from the notes, and (3) use a calendar MCP server to schedule meetings.

**For developers:** MCP reduces development time and complexity for AI applications that need to access various data sources. Before MCP, developers built custom one-off connectors for each data source/tool – duplicating effort. With MCP, a developer can build an MCP server for a data source once, and any MCP-compatible application can use it. This growing open-source ecosystem of MCP servers lets developers leverage existing integrations rather than reinventing them, making it easier to build powerful AI applications that seamlessly integrate with the tools and data their users rely on.

### Key concepts and capabilities

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities to clients:

1. **Resources:** File-like data that can be read by clients (e.g. file contents, database records, API responses).
2. **Tools:** Functions or actions that the AI model can execute (with user approval), enabling the model to interact with external systems.
3. **Prompts:** Pre-written templated messages and workflows that help users or the AI accomplish specific tasks.

These capabilities are standardized in MCP so that any client can use any server’s resources, tools, or prompts in a uniform way. In practice, this means an AI host can *discover* what a server offers and make those resources/tools available to the AI model.

**Why does MCP matter?** It creates a *universal adapter* for connecting AI to data and tools, just as USB-C standardized hardware connections. Before MCP, integrating an AI assistant with a new data source or API required custom coding; now developers and organizations can reuse standardized MCP integrations (servers) or build new ones that any MCP-compatible AI app can use. This modularity accelerates development of AI features and fosters an ecosystem where community-contributed MCP servers benefit everyone.

**Support and feedback:** If you want to get help or provide feedback about MCP, you can create a GitHub issue for bugs/feature requests (open source projects), participate in specification discussions on GitHub, or engage in community Q\&A via GitHub discussions. For questions related to specific products (like Claude’s integration), see the vendor’s support channels.

## Quickstart: For Server Developers

*Get started building your own MCP server to use in Claude for Desktop and other clients.*

In this tutorial, we’ll build a simple MCP Weather Server and connect it to a host (Claude for Desktop). We’ll start with a basic setup and then progress to more complex use cases.

### What we’ll be building

Many LLMs cannot fetch live weather forecasts or alerts on their own. We’ll use MCP to solve that by building a server that exposes two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`. We will then connect this server to an MCP host (Claude for Desktop) to demonstrate its use. *(Note: MCP servers can connect to any MCP-compatible client; Claude Desktop is used here for simplicity. Remote/cloud hosts like Claude.ai are not yet supported by MCP – currently MCP works with locally run hosts such as desktop applications.)*

**Core MCP Concepts:** MCP servers can provide: **Resources** (data for the model/user to read), **Tools** (actions the model can perform), and **Prompts** (reusable prompt templates). This quickstart will focus primarily on **tools** (exposing functions the model can invoke).

**Prerequisite knowledge:** This guide assumes you are comfortable with Python programming and have basic understanding of LLMs like Claude.

#### Setting up the environment (Python)

We will implement the Weather server in Python. Ensure you have the following:

* **System requirements:** Mac or Windows computer, Python installed (latest version), and the `uv` CLI (a tool for AI app development) installed.

Create a new project directory and set up a Python virtual environment using `uv`:

```bash
# Create project directory
uv init mcp-weather-server
cd mcp-weather-server

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
uv add mcp fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv
```

This initializes a new MCP server project and installs the MCP Python SDK (`mcp`), a lightweight web framework (FastAPI) and server runner (Uvicorn), plus `python-dotenv` for configuration.

#### Creating the server (Python)

Let’s create our main server script, `weather.py`, and build the basic structure of the MCP server:

```python
# weather.py
from mcp import Server
from mcp.server import stdio_server
from mcp.types import Tool
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()  # load environment variables from .env

# Initialize MCP server
app = Server(name="weather-server", version="1.0.0")

# Define tools list (to be populated later)
tools_list = []
```

Here we import the MCP Server class and supporting modules. We create a new `Server` instance named `"weather-server"`. The `Server` class from the MCP Python SDK allows us to define request handlers for MCP methods (like tool calls, resource reads, etc.). We also prepare a list for tools that we will register.

**Server capabilities:** By default our `Server` has no capabilities. We will add *tools* to it. (If we needed to expose resources or prompts, we would similarly prepare those.)

#### Implementing weather API calls

Our server’s purpose is to fetch weather data. Let’s say we use an external weather API. We will create two tools:

* `get-forecast`: returns the weather forecast for a given location.
* `get-alerts`: returns any severe weather alerts for a location.

For simplicity, we’ll simulate these instead of calling a real API.

```python
import requests  # (if calling a real API)

# Tool 1: get-forecast
@app.tool(name="get-forecast", description="Get weather forecast for a location")
async def get_forecast(location: str) -> str:
    """Return a simulated weather forecast for the given location."""
    # In a real server, you'd call an external API here.
    return f"The weather forecast for {location} is sunny with a high of 25°C."

# Tool 2: get-alerts
@app.tool(name="get-alerts", description="Get severe weather alerts for a location")
async def get_alerts(location: str) -> str:
    """Return simulated weather alerts for the given location."""
    return f"There are no severe weather alerts for {location} at this time."
```

Here we use the `@app.tool` decorator provided by the MCP Python SDK to register two tool functions with our server. Each tool has a `name` (the identifier that the client/LLM will use) and a `description` to help the AI understand what the tool does. The function signature defines expected parameters (in this case, a `location` string) and return type. Our implementations simply return hardcoded responses (in a real server, you would integrate with an API like OpenWeatherMap or similar).

When the server receives a `tools/call` request for `get-forecast` or `get-alerts`, it will execute the corresponding Python function and return the result.

#### Running the server

Finally, we need to start the server so it can accept client connections:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use stdio transport to listen for client connections
    async with stdio_server() as streams:
        await app.run(streams[0], streams[1], app.create_initialization_options())
```

This uses the *stdio transport*, meaning the server will communicate via its standard input/output streams (appropriate when the server is launched as a subprocess by a client). The `app.run()` method starts handling incoming MCP requests.

**Complete code:** The full `weather.py` can be found in the quickstart repository.

#### Testing the server with Claude Desktop

Now that we have a server, let’s connect it to an MCP host. We’ll use **Claude Desktop** as the client:

1. **Add server to Claude Desktop config:** Open Claude Desktop’s configuration and add an entry for our weather server. For example, in Claude’s JSON config:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "weather": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/path/to/weather.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   This tells Claude to launch our `weather.py` via Python as an MCP server named "weather". (Replace `"/path/to/weather.py"` with the actual path.)

2. **Start Claude Desktop:** Launch Claude for Desktop. It should read the config and spawn our `weather.py` server. You should see in Claude’s UI or logs that it connected to a server with tools `get-forecast` and `get-alerts` (our server printed those tool names on initialization).

3. **Use the tools via Claude:** In a Claude chat, you can now ask something like: *“What is the weather forecast for Paris?”* Claude will recognize it has an MCP tool for forecasts. It will (with your permission) invoke `get-forecast` on our server. Our server returns the answer, and Claude presents it. Similarly, you can ask: *“Are there any weather alerts for Paris?”* and Claude might call `get-alerts`.

**How it works behind the scenes:** When you ask a question, Claude’s client sends a `tools/list` request to our server to get tool descriptions, then includes those in the LLM prompt. Claude’s LLM decides to use a tool (in this case, sees that `get-forecast` might be relevant). Claude then sends a `tools/call` request to our MCP server. Our server executes `get_forecast(location)` and returns the result text. Claude inserts that result back into the conversation (as if the assistant performed that action) and continues the dialogue. This cycle may repeat if multiple tool calls are needed.

**Why Claude Desktop (not Claude.ai):** Currently MCP is supported in local hosts like Claude Desktop. The cloud Claude.ai interface does not support connecting to local MCP servers.

#### Next steps

From here, you can extend the server by adding more tools or resources. For example, you could add a resource that provides a weekly weather report PDF, or a prompt that guides the user to ask for forecasts. You can also integrate authentication if using a real API, and handle errors (e.g., if the API fails, return a meaningful error message for the AI to relay).

**Common customization points:**

1. *Tool Handling:* Add input validation or error handling in the tool functions (e.g., ensure location strings are valid).
2. *Response Formatting:* Customize how results are formatted (our server just returns plain text; you could return structured data if the client supports it).
3. *Security:* If tools perform sensitive operations, make sure to include checks or user confirmation steps. Use `.env` to handle API keys securely, etc.

With this basic server running, any MCP-compatible client could use it – not just Claude, but potentially other AI apps that support MCP’s standard tool interface.

## Quickstart: For Client Developers

*Get started building your own client that can integrate with all MCP servers.*

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build an LLM-powered **chatbot client** that connects to MCP servers. (It helps to have gone through the server quickstart above to understand MCP basics.) We will create a command-line chatbot that can use any MCP server’s tools and resources. The example will be in Python, but analogous steps apply for Node.js, Java, Kotlin, or C# clients.

**System Requirements:** Mac or Windows computer, latest Python installed, and `uv` CLI installed.

#### Setting Up Your Environment (Python)

First, create a new Python project for the client using `uv`:

```bash
# Create project directory
uv init mcp-client
cd mcp-client

# Create virtual environment
uv venv
# Activate venv (Windows):
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate venv (Unix/Mac):
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
uv add mcp anthropic python-dotenv

# Remove default boilerplate file
rm main.py  # (or del main.py on Windows)

# Create our client script
touch client.py
```

This sets up a project with the MCP Python SDK (`mcp`), Anthropics’ Python SDK (`anthropic` for Claude API), and `python-dotenv` for loading API keys.

#### Setting Up Your API Key

You’ll need an **Anthropic API key** to use Claude’s API. Create a `.env` file in your project and add your key:

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key here>" > .env
```

For security, ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` so the key is not committed to source control.

#### Creating the Client (Python)

We will build a simple `MCPClient` class to manage the connection to an MCP server and handle message exchange with Claude. Start by creating the basic structure in `client.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Optional
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client
from anthropic import Anthropic
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # load API key from .env

class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self):
        # Prepare session and Anthropic client
        self.session: Optional[ClientSession] = None
        self.exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
        self.anthropic = Anthropic()
    # (methods will be added below)
```

Key points:

* We use `ClientSession` from MCP to manage the client side of a connection, and `stdio_client` to launch servers via stdio transport.
* `Anthropic` is used to call Claude’s API (we assume `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in the environment).

##### Server Connection Management

Next, implement a method to connect to an MCP server given a path to the server script:

```python
async def connect_to_server(self, server_script_path: str):
    """Connect to an MCP server given the server script (.py or .js) path."""
    is_python = server_script_path.endswith('.py')
    is_js = server_script_path.endswith('.js')
    if not (is_python or is_js):
        raise ValueError("Server script must be a .py or .js file")

    # Determine command based on file type
    command = "python" if is_python else "node"
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command=command,
        args=[server_script_path],
        env=None
    )

    # Launch the server as a subprocess and connect via stdio
    stdio_transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
    self.stdio, self.write = stdio_transport  # streams for comms
    self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write))

    await self.session.initialize()
    # After init, list available tools on the server:
    response = await self.session.list_tools()
    tools = response.tools
    print("\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in tools])
```

This method uses `StdioServerParameters` to specify how to start the server (either via Python or Node, depending on extension). It then enters two asynchronous context managers: one to start the stdio client transport (`stdio_client(...)` which launches the server), and another to create a `ClientSession` for the connection. After calling `initialize()`, it performs a `list_tools` request to fetch what tools the server provides, and prints their names for confirmation.

##### Query Processing Logic

Now add the core functionality to process user queries by interacting with Claude and the MCP tools:

```python
async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
    """Process a user query using Claude and available MCP tools."""
    messages = [
        { "role": "user", "content": query }
    ]

    # Get available tools (names, descriptions, schemas)
    response = await self.session.list_tools()
    available_tools = [{
        "name": tool.name,
        "description": tool.description,
        "input_schema": tool.inputSchema
    } for tool in response.tools]

    # Initial Claude API call with the user query and tool list
    response = self.anthropic.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=messages,
        tools=available_tools
    )

    final_text = []
    assistant_message_content = []
    for content in response.content:
        if content.type == 'text':
            final_text.append(content.text)
            assistant_message_content.append(content)
        elif content.type == 'tool_use':
            tool_name = content.name
            tool_args = content.input

            # Execute the requested tool through MCP
            result = await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
            final_text.append(f"[Calling tool {tool_name} with args {tool_args}]")

            # Add the tool call and result to conversation history
            assistant_message_content.append(content)
            messages.append({
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": assistant_message_content
            })
            messages.append({
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "tool_result",
                        "tool_use_id": content.id,
                        "content": result.content
                    }
                ]
            })

            # Get next response from Claude after tool execution
            response = self.anthropic.messages.create(
                model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                max_tokens=1000,
                messages=messages,
                tools=available_tools
            )
            final_text.append(response.content[0].text)
    return "\n".join(final_text)
```

This function sends the user query to Claude’s API, including the list of available tools from the server. It then parses Claude’s response:

* If the response content is text, it’s appended to the final output.
* If Claude outputs a `tool_use` (indicating it wants to call a tool), the client calls `session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)` to execute the tool on the server. We log the tool call in the output (for transparency).
* We then update the conversation history by adding the assistant’s tool request and a simulated user message containing the tool result.
* We call Claude’s API again with the updated messages (this lets Claude incorporate the tool result into its reasoning).
* We append Claude’s new response text and continue, though in this simple loop we assume only one tool call per query for brevity.

Finally, we return the assembled `final_text` which includes Claude’s answers and any tool-call annotations.

##### Interactive Chat Interface

Next, implement an interactive chat loop to handle multiple queries and user input:

```python
async def chat_loop(self):
    """Run an interactive chat loop."""
    print("\nMCP Client Started!")
    print("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.")
    while True:
        try:
            query = input("\nQuery: ").strip()
            if query.lower() == 'quit':
                break
            response = await self.process_query(query)
            print("\n" + response)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\nError: {str(e)}")
```

This uses Python’s `input()` to read from the console (since we’re not in an async context for input, this code is synchronous). It sends each query to `process_query` and prints the result. If an exception occurs (e.g., the server disconnected), it prints an error message and continues.

We also add a cleanup method to close the session when done:

```python
async def cleanup(self):
    """Clean up resources"""
    await self.exit_stack.aclose()
```

This ensures all opened transports and sessions are closed properly.

##### Main entry point

Finally, tie it together with a main function to parse command-line arguments and run the chat:

```python
async def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python client.py <path_to_server_script>")
        sys.exit(1)
    client = MCPClient()
    try:
        await client.connect_to_server(sys.argv[1])
        await client.chat_loop()
    finally:
        await client.cleanup()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This expects a server script path as an argument. It connects to the server, enters the chat loop, and always attempts cleanup at the end.

**Running the client:** Use `uv` or Python to run the client, specifying a server. For example, to connect to the weather server from earlier:

```bash
uv run client.py ../quickstart-resources/weather-server-python/weather.py
```

Or directly with Python:

```bash
python client.py path/to/weather.py
```

On running, the client will:

1. Launch the specified server (as a subprocess via stdio).
2. List the server’s tools and print them (e.g., “Connected to server with tools: \['get-forecast','get-alerts']”).
3. Enter an interactive loop where you can type queries and see responses (with tool usage transparently shown).

For example, you might see:

```
MCP Client Started!
Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.

Query: What is the weather forecast for Paris?

[Calling tool get-forecast with args {'location': 'Paris'}]
The weather forecast for Paris is sunny with a high of 25°C.
```

This shows the client called the `get-forecast` tool on the server and then Claude’s response (which includes the forecast).

##### How It Works

When you submit a query, the following happens behind the scenes:

1. The client retrieves the list of available tools from the server (`list_tools`).
2. The client sends your query plus the tool descriptions to the Claude API.
3. Claude’s response may include an instruction to use a tool (as `tool_use`).
4. The client executes the tool via the MCP server (`call_tool`) and gets the result.
5. The tool result is fed back into Claude (continuing the conversation).
6. Claude responds with an answer incorporating the tool’s information.
7. The client displays Claude’s final response to you.

All of this happens in a few seconds (the first response may be slower as the server initializes and Claude processes, typically up to \~30 seconds). Subsequent queries are usually faster.

##### Best practices for MCP client development

* **Error Handling:** Always wrap tool invocations in try-catch (or error checks) and handle exceptions gracefully (e.g., if `call_tool` fails, present an error to the user). Use timeouts or checks to avoid hanging if a server doesn’t respond.
* **Resource Management:** Use context managers (like our `AsyncExitStack`) to ensure transports and sessions close properly. Clean up on exit to avoid orphan processes. Handle server disconnections (e.g., detect if `session` becomes closed and prompt to reconnect).
* **Security:** Never expose sensitive info from `.env`. Validate responses from servers if needed – e.g., if a server returns unexpected data, handle it. Limit what tools you allow or at least inform the user what tools will be used. Since tools can execute code or actions, ensure the user trusts the server. Use Claude’s “approval” steps (Claude Desktop will prompt the user to allow each tool call) for safety.
* **Extensibility:** Our example is single-server. For a more robust client, you can connect to multiple servers (each via its own `ClientSession`) to provide a variety of tools/resources to the AI.

**Multi-language notes:** The above was Python-focused. MCP has SDKs in TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C#, etc., which provide similar abstractions:

* In **TypeScript/Node.js**, you would use the `Client` class and `StdioClientTransport` from the MCP TypeScript SDK. The structure (connect, listTools, callTool, etc.) is analogous. Use Node’s `readline` for interactive input and `process.execPath` (Node executable path) to spawn Node or use Python for .py servers.
* In **Java/Kotlin**, you can use the Spring AI MCP client (as shown in the tutorials below) or the raw SDK. In Java, an `McpClient` can be created and connected with a certain transport (stdio or SSE). The workflow (list tools, call tools) remains the same.
* **Claude Desktop vs Custom Client:** If you are building your own client (like we did), you get full control over the UI/UX and how tool usage is handled. If you integrate MCP into an existing app (e.g., add MCP support to an IDE or chatbot), follow the patterns above to manage sessions and tool calls.

* **Todoist** – Task management integration (Todoist API) via MCP.

> **Note:** Community servers are untested and should be used at your own risk. They are not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.

For a complete and up-to-date list of community servers, visit the **MCP Servers Repository** or the **Awesome MCP Servers** list.

### Getting started with example servers

**Using reference servers:** Many official servers (especially those written in TypeScript) can be run directly via `npx` without needing a separate setup. For example:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

This would launch the "Memory" reference server via npx. Similarly, Python-based servers can be run with the `uvx` tool or pip:

```bash
# Using uvx (if installed via pipx or pip)
uvx mcp-server-git

# Or using pip and python
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

The above commands launch the Git server (providing Git repository tools) either via `uvx` or directly. Each server’s README will have exact instructions.

**Configuring with Claude (or other hosts):** To use an MCP server with Claude Desktop (for instance), you add it to Claude’s configuration file under `mcpServers`. For example, to add the Memory, Filesystem, and GitHub servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude will then automatically launch these servers (Memory, Filesystem, GitHub) as subprocesses when it starts. The `env` section is used here to provide a required token to the GitHub server.

### Additional resources

* **Awesome MCP Servers (GitHub)** – A curated list of MCP servers, libraries, and related resources.
* **MCP CLI** – A command-line inspector for testing MCP servers (allows sending requests to servers interactively).
* **MCP Get (mcp-get.com)** – A tool for installing and managing MCP servers (like a package manager for MCP servers).
* **Pipedream MCP** – MCP servers with built-in auth for thousands of APIs and tools (hosted solution via Pipedream).
* **Supergateway** – Run MCP stdio servers over SSE (bridge stdio-based servers to an HTTP/SSE interface).
* **Zapier MCP** – An MCP server integrating with Zapier’s 7,000+ apps and 30,000+ actions (for extensive automation).

## Example Clients

*Applications that support MCP integrations (each client may support different MCP features).*

This section provides an overview of applications that act as **MCP hosts**, meaning they can connect to MCP servers to extend their capabilities. Each client may implement different parts of MCP (resources, prompts, tools, etc.), so a feature support matrix is included.

* **BoltAI** – a native AI chat client (desktop & mobile) supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and local models. For MCP, it allows users to import configurations (e.g., from Claude Desktop) and enable specific servers on a per-chat basis. It also has an “AI Command” feature to invoke MCP tools from any app.

* **Claude Code** – an interactive coding assistant by Anthropic (part of Claude ecosystem). It supports **prompts and tools via MCP** for coding tasks, and interestingly, Claude Code itself can act as an MCP server to provide its own coding tools to other clients. Key features: tool and prompt support for using external servers, and offering its internal tools through MCP to other apps.

* **Claude Desktop App** – the desktop version of Claude with **comprehensive MCP support**. It can attach local files and data as resources, use prompt templates, integrate tools, and connect to local servers for privacy. *(Note: The Claude **web** app does not support MCP; only the desktop app does.)*

* **Cline** – an autonomous AI coding agent extension for VS Code. It uses MCP to allow dynamic tool creation (e.g., “add a tool that searches the web” leads to adding an MCP server tool). It displays configured MCP servers and their tools/resources in the editor UI, and logs errors from servers for debugging.

* **Continue** – an open-source AI code assistant (VS Code and JetBrains plugin) with first-class MCP integration. It supports *all* MCP features: you can mention resources by typing “@” to insert them, prompts appear as slash commands, and you can use built-in or MCP-provided tools directly in chat.

* **Copilot-MCP** – an extension that brings MCP to GitHub Copilot (presumably to allow Copilot to use MCP tools). It supports sending MCP tool and resource information to Copilot, integrating with development workflows.

* **Cursor** – an AI-driven code editor. It supports using MCP tools within its “Composer” environment, and can connect to MCP servers over both stdio and SSE transports.

* **Daydreams Agents** – a framework for on-chain agentic operations. It supports configuring MCP servers in its agent configs and exposes an MCP client for those agents to use.

* **Emacs MCP** – an Emacs plugin to interface with MCP servers. It allows Emacs AI packages (like `gptel` or `llm`) to invoke MCP tools using standard Emacs command formats. Essentially, it adds MCP tool support to Emacs’ AI integrations.

* **fast-agent** – a Python framework for building agents and workflows, with multi-modal support (text, PDF, images). It has built-in support for MCP:

  * Agents can be **deployed as MCP servers** (so others can use them).
  * It includes interactive front-end and simulators for development.
  * It supports *passthrough* (direct tool usage) and *playback simulators* to test agent behavior.
  * It implements many patterns from Anthropic’s “Building Effective Agents” guide.

* **FLUJO** – a desktop application (Next.js/React) for building AI workflows. It integrates with MCP to allow workflow nodes that use MCP tools. It can work offline (with local models via Ollama) or online. It manages API keys and environment centrally, and can install MCP servers from GitHub. It even has a ChatCompletions API endpoint and can be controlled from other AI apps like Cline or Roo.

* **Genkit** – an SDK for GenAI features; its MCP plugin (`genkitx-mcp`) lets Genkit-based apps consume MCP servers or even create MCP servers from Genkit’s own tools/prompts. It provides rich discovery in a dev UI and works across many model providers.

* **Glama** – an AI workspace/integration platform. It features integrated directories for MCP servers and tools, allows hosting MCP servers, and has chat interfaces that can talk to multiple LLMs and MCP servers simultaneously. Essentially it’s a unified interface that embraces MCP for connecting to external tools/data.

* **GenAIScript** – a JavaScript DSL for assembling LLM prompts and orchestrating tools. It can orchestrate MCP tools as part of its workflows (since it can call functions and you can plug MCP calls into those).

* **Goose** – an open source agent that automates software dev tasks. It exposes MCP functionality by treating MCP tools as Goose extensions. Goose has an extensions directory where MCP servers can be added (the documentation mentions installing MCPs via CLI or UI). Goose also provides built-in tools (web scraping, JetBrains integration, etc.) and can use MCP to extend further.

* **gptme** – a terminal-based personal AI (think “shell assistant”). It has its own set of built-in tools (shell commands, code execution, file ops, web browsing) and focuses on simplicity. While not explicitly stating MCP, it can be extended and one could imagine integrating MCP tools by bridging its plugin system.

* **HyperAgent** – extends Microsoft’s Playwright for browser automation with AI commands. It allows integration of MCP servers as additional capabilities (so instead of writing code for an automation, the AI can call an MCP tool like Composio for certain tasks). It emphasizes “stealth” browser automation and can scale to many sessions via Hyperbrowser, and mentions connecting to tools like Composio through MCP.

* **Klavis AI** – provides Slack, Discord, and web clients for MCP. It features a web UI dashboard to configure MCP servers easily, and does OAuth for Slack/Discord to securely connect servers on behalf of users. It supports SSE transport and is fully open-source.

* **LibreChat** – an open-source ChatGPT UI alternative. It now supports MCP integration: you can extend its existing tools (like code execution or image gen) by adding MCP servers as new tools or agents. Multi-user support and plans for expanding MCP features are mentioned.

* **Lutra** – an AI agent platform to transform conversations into automated workflows. *MCP integration:* extremely simple – just provide the server URL and Lutra will use it behind the scenes. Lutra can automatically perform tasks via connected apps and then save those as reusable “playbooks” (workflows), which can be shared. It essentially leverages MCP to actually perform the actions.

* **mcp-agent** – a Python framework making it easy to connect LLMs to MCP servers and orchestrate them. It automatically manages connections to multiple servers, exposes all their tools to the LLM, and implements patterns for pausing workflows (e.g., waiting for human input). It emphasizes handling multiple servers at once and embedding into agent workflows.

* **mcp-use** – an open-source Python library that abstracts away MCP connection details. With a few lines, you can connect any LLM (OpenAI, local, etc.) to any MCP server (local or remote). It supports connecting to multiple servers simultaneously and orchestrating their tools. It’s basically a utility to “use” MCP without dealing with transport or session code.

* **MCPHub** – a Neovim plugin providing a full UI for MCP in the editor. You can install/configure MCP servers via a menu, and it even includes a built-in MCP server for file operations (reading/writing files, searching code, etc.). It lets you create Lua-based MCP servers on the fly as well. It integrates with Neovim’s AI chat plugins to use those servers in chat.

* **MCPOmni-Connect** – a versatile command-line MCP client. It supports connecting to multiple servers using both STDIO and SSE transports, and implements **all** main MCP features: resources, prompts, tools, and even agentic sampling mode. It also has “Agentic mode with ReAct and orchestrator” – meaning it can behave like an agent itself, orchestrating multiple tools. This is a powerful CLI for power-users.

* **Microsoft Copilot Studio** – a web platform for building AI apps/agents (by Microsoft). It allows developers to extend their Copilot Studio agents with MCP servers’ tools. Essentially, if an agent in Copilot Studio needs some capability, you could plug in an MCP server to provide it. This is targeted at enterprise developers building with Microsoft’s AI stack.

* **MindPal** – a no-code platform for business process AI agents. It supports connecting to any SSE-based MCP server to extend its agent tools. Non-technical users can use MindPal’s interface to incorporate MCP-provided tools. Ongoing development promises deeper MCP support.

* **Msty Studio** – an AI productivity platform focusing on privacy (runs local and online LLMs). It uses *Toolbox & Toolsets* concepts where you can connect AI models to local scripts via MCP-like configs (the wording suggests MCP compliance in how tools are configured). It has features like “Turnstiles” (multi-step interactions) and multi-chat branching. It likely uses MCP under the hood for connecting to local tools.

* **OpenSumi** – an extensible IDE framework. It provides quick support for AI integration. It supports MCP tools within the IDE and can work with built-in IDE-specific MCP servers or custom ones. Essentially, an OpenSumi-based IDE can let an AI agent call IDE functions or external tools via MCP.

* **oterm** – a terminal UI for the Ollama LLM engine. It allows multiple concurrent chat/agent sessions, and crucially supports *MCP tools* in those sessions. It also supports sending prompt “samples” to LLMs (like having the LLM generate content), which presumably is the *sampling* feature support (as indicated by ✅ under Sampling for oterm). This allows, for example, hooking up an agent in oterm that can run code or fetch web content via MCP tools.

* **Roo Code** – an AI coding assistant similar to GitHub Copilot, with MCP integration. It supports MCP tools and resources to augment its coding suggestions. Extensible AI capabilities likely means you can plug in any MCP server (e.g., one that runs tests or linters on code).

* **Postman** – a widely used API client. Postman added support for MCP to help developers test and debug MCP servers with a GUI. It fully supports all major MCP features – listing tools, invoking them, listing resources, prompt subscriptions, etc.. Postman provides a UI to send requests and see notifications, making it easier to develop MCP servers without writing a client from scratch.

* **Slack MCP Client** – a bridge that allows using MCP servers through Slack’s interface. An LLM (like Claude via Slack) can use Slack messages to trigger MCP tools. It supports popular LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) and securely manages credentials via env vars or K8s secrets. It offers easy deployment (Docker, Helm charts) to integrate with corporate Slack setups.

* **Sourcegraph Cody** – Sourcegraph’s AI coding assistant. It implements MCP via the **OpenCTX** protocol. Specifically, it supports MCP *resources* (which likely maps to Cody being able to fetch code or docs from a Sourcegraph index). OpenCTX is an abstraction, but under the hood it aligns with MCP concepts. They plan to add more MCP features in the future.

* **SpinAI** – an observable AI agent framework (TypeScript). It natively supports MCP for integrating agent tools. Essentially, SpinAI agents can incorporate MCP tools seamlessly, since the framework was built with that compatibility in mind.

* **Superinterface** – a platform for embedding AI assistants in apps or websites. It supports using tools from MCP servers within those assistants (e.g., a React component embedding an assistant that can call MCP tools). It supports SSE transport to connect to servers, and works with any AI model/provider. This is aimed at developers adding an AI assistant widget to their app with extended capabilities via MCP.

* **Theia AI / Theia IDE** – Theia is a framework for building IDEs (like VS Code alternatives). *Theia AI* adds AI features. The AI-powered Theia IDE supports MCP in multiple ways: tools integration (agents in the IDE can use MCP servers), customizable prompts that incorporate MCP actions, and creating custom agents that leverage MCP for workflows. They even announced these features and offer downloads for the AI-enhanced IDE.

* **Tome** – an open source desktop app for working with local LLMs and MCP servers. It abstracts away configuration and allows beginners to use MCP without code. Tome manages the lifecycle of MCP servers (so you don’t need `uv` or command-line), providing a UI to add/remove servers. Any local model via Ollama can be used with these tools. It basically makes MCP plug-and-play.

* **TypingMind** – a popular web-based ChatGPT frontend. It added MCP support by treating MCP tools as “plugins” in the UI that can be toggled. You can assign a set of MCP servers to a custom AI agent profile. TypingMind also supports remote MCP connectors, meaning you can run servers on another machine and connect via the app (so you could have a mobile device use an MCP server running on your PC).

* **VS Code (GitHub Copilot in Agent mode)** – Microsoft’s VS Code has an experimental “agent mode” for Copilot that allows it to use external tools. They integrate MCP by allowing an agent session to pick from MCP tools and roots (shared context). For example, it supports dynamic discovery of tools/roots, secure handling of API keys, restart commands for servers, etc.. Essentially, as you work in VS Code, Copilot can leverage MCP servers to do things like run tests, access files, etc., and you can manage those via VS Code’s UI.

* **Windsurf Editor** – an IDE by Codeium focusing on “AI Flow” collaboration. It supports MCP tools (and roots) via SSE. Specifically, multiple developers (or AI agents) can collaborate, and MCP tools are part of that workflow. It touts a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration with rich development tools support.

* **Witsy** – an AI desktop assistant supporting Anthropic’s models and MCP. It allows multiple MCP servers to be connected at once, executing commands or scripts locally with those servers. It’s cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) and open-source. It can be installed easily and provides an interface for using those tools.

* **Zed** – a high-performance code editor. It has built-in MCP support but focuses mostly on prompt templates and tool integration; it explicitly does *not* support MCP resources. In Zed, prompt templates appear as slash commands, and tools can be invoked in the editor for enhanced coding workflows. It also integrates with workspace context, but if you need file content, that may not be supported via MCP yet in Zed.

## FAQs

**Explaining MCP and why it matters, in simple terms.**

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a **standard way for AI applications and agents to connect to and work with your data sources** (e.g. local files, databases, content repositories) **and tools** (e.g. GitHub, Google Maps, or web browsers). Think of MCP as a **universal adapter for AI applications**, similar to what USB-C is for physical devices.

Before USB-C, you needed different cables for different devices. Similarly, before MCP, developers had to write custom connectors for each data source or API they wanted their AI to use. This was time-consuming and often limited an AI’s functionality to only a few integrations. **Now, with MCP, developers can easily add standardized connections to their AI applications** – making those applications much more powerful and versatile from day one.

In short, MCP defines a common protocol (based on JSON-RPC) so that any AI app can talk to any integration following that protocol. It handles things like how an AI app can list what a server offers, request data (resources), use tools, etc., in a consistent way.

### Why does MCP matter?

**For AI application users:** It means your AI tools (chatbots, assistants, IDE helpers, etc.) can access the actual information and tools you use in your daily life, not just generic training data. Your AI assistant isn’t stuck with its pre-existing knowledge; with MCP it can, for example, read your company’s documentation, check your calendar, fetch data from your database, or use services like Google Drive on your behalf – *if you allow it*. This makes AI much more context-aware and personalized to you.

A concrete scenario: Suppose you ask an AI assistant, “Summarize last week’s team meeting notes and schedule follow-ups with everyone.” Without MCP, an AI might not have those notes or any means to schedule meetings. With MCP, the AI (with your permission) could:

* Connect to a Google Drive MCP server to retrieve the meeting notes document.
* Analyze the notes to see action items and persons responsible.
* Connect to a Calendar MCP server to create follow-up meetings with those people.

All that can happen seamlessly, whereas previously an AI couldn’t do those multi-step, context-rich tasks unless custom integrated with each service.

**For developers:** MCP dramatically simplifies adding such integrations. Instead of writing one integration for Google Drive for App A, another for App B, etc., a developer can write an MCP server for Google Drive once. Then any MCP-compatible app (present or future) can use it. This avoids duplicated effort and yields more consistent, reliable integrations. It also means an open-source community can emerge where people contribute MCP servers for various systems (Slack, Jira, databases, etc.), and all AI apps benefit. Developers building AI applications can focus on the AI logic and UI, not on reinventing connectors for common services.

In summary, MCP matters because it **unlocks AI access to real-world context** in a safe, structured manner, and it **accelerates development** by standardizing how that access works.

### How does MCP work?

MCP creates a bridge between AI applications and data/tools through a simple client-server model:

* **MCP Servers** connect to data sources or services (like Google Drive, Slack, databases) and expose their content or capabilities in a standardized way.
* **MCP Clients** are incorporated into AI applications to connect to those servers.
* When you give permission, the AI application (client) can discover what servers are available and what they offer.
* The AI model can then request information or actions via those servers.

For example, an MCP server might expose a folder of files as “resources” and a search function as a “tool.” The AI app’s client would list available resources/tools, then when the AI needs something (like reading a file or performing search), it sends a request to the server and gets a result.

**Key point:** It’s modular – new MCP servers can be added without changing the AI application. It’s like how you can plug a new accessory into your computer and it works via the USB port, rather than needing to modify the computer for each new device.

Communication between clients and servers uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** messages over various transports (stdio, HTTP+SSE, etc.). The protocol defines standard method names and data formats (for listing tools, reading resources, calling tools, etc.), so that different implementations all speak the same “language.”

### Who creates and maintains MCP servers?

MCP servers are built by a mix of contributors:

* **Anthropic and core MCP developers:** They create reference servers for common services (as we saw in Example Servers, e.g., GitHub, Google Drive, etc.).
* **Open source community:** Independent developers build servers for tools they care about (e.g., someone might build a Notion MCP server or a Snowflake DB server).
* **Enterprise teams:** A company might build private MCP servers for internal systems (like an MCP server for their proprietary database or CRM).
* **Software vendors:** A company offering a product (e.g., a SaaS platform) might provide an official MCP server to let AI agents interface with their product (as we saw with BrowserStack, Stripe, etc., in official integrations).

Once an MCP server exists for a given tool or data source, any MCP-compatible app can use it. This encourages a network effect: more servers make MCP more useful, which encourages more apps to support MCP, which in turn motivates creation of more servers, and so on.

Anthropic and the community maintain an **MCP Servers Registry** (in development, see the Roadmap) to help discover servers, and they maintain SDKs to make building servers easier. Each server should have a maintainer (e.g., the GitHub server is maintained by Anthropic; a community server is maintained by its author unless adopted by core team).

### How is MCP different from other integration methods?

MCP is similar in spirit to protocols like **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** (which standardized how code editors integrate programming language features). Just as LSP lets any editor use any language server, MCP lets any AI app use any integration server.

Compared to building custom APIs or plugins for each app, MCP provides a **unified interface**. For example, without MCP, if you wanted ChatGPT to access your files, you’d need a plugin specific to ChatGPT. If you also wanted a different AI app to access files, you’d need another integration for that app. With MCP, a single “Filesystem” server works for any AI client that speaks MCP.

Technically, MCP is a **JSON-RPC-based protocol**. It’s not tied to a vendor (open standard) and not tied to a specific model. It is extensible (you can add new methods or capabilities via version negotiation). It focuses on a few core areas (resources, tools, prompts, sampling) that cover a wide range of use cases.

### How does security and privacy work in MCP?

Security is critical because MCP servers can expose sensitive data or perform actions (tools). The protocol and best practices include several safety principles:

* **User consent and control:** The user must explicitly enable and allow MCP servers. AI applications (hosts) should ask for approval before connecting to a server, before a tool is executed, etc. Users should always know and control what data is shared or what actions are taken. For instance, Claude Desktop pops up a confirmation when a tool is invoked, and it doesn’t send any file contents to the model unless you approve sending a resource.

* **Data privacy:** Hosts should not send your data to servers or elsewhere without permission. Data stays within your environment unless you allow it (for local files, the server runs locally; for external APIs, you provide keys and consent to API calls). Using MCP within your own infrastructure (like running a database server on your machine) means data doesn’t leave your environment except to the LLM under controlled circumstances.

* **Tool safety:** Tools essentially execute code or API calls. Descriptions of tools (provided by servers) cannot always be trusted (a malicious server could mislabel a dangerous tool). So, hosts and users should treat tool use with caution. The recommendation is to always get explicit user consent before running a tool and ensure the user understands what it does. MCP clients often sandbox tool execution (e.g., running them only in certain environments) and limit what they can do (e.g., file system servers have configurable allowed paths).

* **LLM sampling controls:** If a server requests the AI model to generate text on its behalf (the “Sampling” feature, where a server can ask the client’s LLM to produce an output), the user must approve it. Users should be able to see and even edit the prompt that will be sent, decide if the server is allowed to see the response, etc. By design, MCP’s sampling feature hides the conversation history from servers (server only gets what the user allows).

* **Transport security:** If using network transports like HTTP for remote servers, always use encryption (TLS) to prevent eavesdropping. For SSE, validate origins to prevent web pages from abusing a local server (DNS rebinding attacks are a known vector; the documentation explicitly warns about SSE security).

In practice, **Claude Desktop’s implementation** of MCP provides a good example: it runs all servers locally by default (so data stays local unless the server itself calls out, like to an API), it prompts the user for each tool use, and it has an allow-list of server commands that can be run. Similarly, the code of conduct for building servers and clients emphasizes security considerations.

### How can I contribute to MCP or get involved?

To contribute:

* **Join the community discussions** on GitHub – there are discussion boards for the specification and for general MCP topics.
* **Contribute code or docs:** The MCP spec and docs are open source. You can make pull requests to propose changes or additions. If you create an MCP server or client, you can contribute it or list it in the Awesome MCP repository.
* **Follow the contributing guidelines** (the documentation links to these) – they cover how to format contributions, the code of conduct, etc.
* **Feedback and feature requests:** You can open issues for bugs or proposals. The roadmap is public, and you can weigh in on priorities or design (e.g., via the Standards Track on GitHub which tracks proposals).
* **Testing and adoption:** Even simply using MCP and reporting your experience or issues is valuable. Implement MCP in your own projects and share lessons learned.

All contributors are expected to follow the project’s **Code of Conduct** (be respectful, etc.).

Anthropic and other maintainers are actively evolving MCP, so community feedback helps shape it. The roadmap shows focus areas (validation suites, registry, agent improvements, multimodality, governance) – if you care about one, you can join those efforts.

**In summary**, MCP is an exciting and evolving standard. It aims to do for AI-tool integration what things like USB or LSP did in their domains – create interoperability and expand capabilities. By using and contributing to MCP, you become part of building an ecosystem where AI systems can safely and flexibly interact with the world around them.

## Tutorials

### Building MCP with LLMs

*Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude!*

This guide shows how you can leverage a frontier LLM (like Anthropic’s Claude) to help you **write MCP servers and clients faster**. Essentially, it’s about using the AI to generate code or templates for MCP integrations by feeding it the right context.

**Preparing the documentation:** First, gather and provide the relevant MCP documentation to the LLM:

1. Use the **full MCP documentation text** – the project provides a single text file containing all important docs (for example, at `modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt`). Copy that and give it to Claude (or your chosen LLM) in the chat, so it has complete knowledge of MCP’s API, message structure, etc.
2. Also provide the **SDK documentation** for the language you plan to use. For instance, link or copy the README from the MCP TypeScript SDK or Python SDK repository.
3. Optionally include code snippets from example servers or clients similar to what you want to build.

The idea is to “prime” Claude with full context on MCP so it can give accurate help.

**Describing your server:** Next, clearly explain to the LLM what you want to build – be specific about the server’s purpose and its capabilities:

* What **resources** will it expose (if any)? (e.g., “table schemas from a database” or “files from a directory”)
* What **tools** it will provide? (e.g., “a tool to run SQL queries” or “a tool to send an email”)
* Any **prompts** it should include? (maybe less common to auto-generate, but could mention)
* What **external systems** it interacts with (so the AI can anticipate needed libraries or API calls).

For example, you might tell Claude:
“Build an MCP server that connects to my company’s PostgreSQL database. It should expose table schemas as resources, provide a tool `run-query` for read-only SQL queries, and include a prompt for common data analysis tasks.”

With the docs loaded and this spec, Claude can start suggesting code.

**Working with Claude:** When using Claude (or another LLM) to generate MCP code:

* **Iteratively prompt for components:** You might ask it first to “Write the server initialization and connection code” then separately “Write the tool handler function for run-query.” This keeps responses focused.
* **Ask for specific formats:** For instance, “Use the Python SDK’s decorator style to define the tool, and ensure you handle database connections safely.”
* **Review and refine:** Always review the AI’s output. Claude might produce something that needs tweaking (for correctness or security). You can iterate: “That looks good. Now add error handling for SQL errors” or “Use parameterized queries in the SQL execution to avoid injection.”
* **Test the generated code:** Try running it and see if it works. If not, feed the error back to Claude for help (“I got this traceback, how do I fix it?”).

Claude can accelerate writing boilerplate or exploring the MCP API usage. It’s especially handy for getting the structure right (like how to use `Server` class, how to call `app.run()`, etc., which the docs cover).

*Note:* Always double-check that the AI’s output adheres to current best practices and that you don’t include sensitive info in your prompts (aside from necessary API keys which you should abstract). Claude is good at following patterns from provided documentation, so providing the **MCP spec and SDK docs** as context is key to getting useful, accurate suggestions.

### Debugging MCP Integrations

*Learn how to effectively debug MCP servers and clients.*

When building or using MCP integrations, you might face issues such as:

* Server not responding or crashing on certain requests.
* Client not receiving expected data or tool outputs.
* Communication errors or timeouts.

Here are strategies for debugging:

**1. Use MCP CLI / Inspector:** The **MCP CLI** (command-line inspector) is a tool designed for testing MCP servers by sending manual requests and seeing the responses and notifications. This is like using Postman but for MCP. You can:

* Start your server independently.
* Use the CLI to issue `list_tools`, `call_tool`, `list_resources`, etc., and observe the output.
* This isolates whether the server logic is correct, independent of your client.

**2. Increase logging:** Both clients and servers in MCP SDKs have logging. For example, the Python SDK uses the `logging` module. Set it to DEBUG level to see message flow:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

This will show JSON-RPC messages being sent/received, errors, etc., in the console. It’s very helpful to see if, say, the server received a request or if a response was malformed.

**3. Check connection states:** Ensure the client successfully called `initialize` and the server answered. If a client call (like `list_tools`) is hanging, maybe `initialize` didn’t complete. Using logging or print statements around initialization on both ends helps.

**4. Validate message formats:** If you implement a custom transport or you’re not using the official SDK, check that your JSON-RPC messages match the spec:

* `jsonrpc` field = "2.0"
* Proper `id` for requests and matching in responses.
* Methods names correct (`tools/list`, etc., exactly as in spec).
* If an error occurs, is it in the JSON-RPC error format?

**5. Use Postman for SSE debugging:** If your server uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport, you can actually simulate it by sending HTTP requests. Postman’s MCP template (if available) can help. Or simply:

* Open the SSE endpoint in a browser or with `curl` to see if events stream.
* Use `curl` to POST a test message to the server’s message endpoint to ensure it’s handled (the server’s SSE example code has an endpoint `/messages` for that).

**6. Step through code:** If possible, run the server in a debugger. Because many servers are async, you might insert some `print()` or use an interactive environment to step through request handlers.

**Common issues:**

* *File paths:* If a FileSystem server returns a `FileNotFoundError`, check the path and ensure your allowed roots are correct (and match what you requested).
* *Connection refused:* If a client can’t connect to server, maybe the server process didn’t start. Check the path/command or run the server manually to verify it starts.
* *Tool execution failed:* Look at the server console for exceptions in the tool function. Ensure required environment variables (e.g., API keys) are set (the error might be from an external API call failing).
* *Timeouts:* If an operation times out, maybe the LLM took too long or the server took too long. Increase timeouts if needed (some clients allow setting a timeout for `call_tool`).

**Troubleshooting performance:**

* First calls can be slow (server startup + model initial response). Subsequent calls should be faster. This is normal.
* If every call is slow, check if the server is performing a heavy operation each time (like re-initializing an API client on every request – you might want to persist connections).

**Tool outputs not used by model:**

* Make sure you format tool results as specified (the `tool_result` content object should be correct and include the `tool_use_id` that matches what model output).
* Also ensure the client is feeding the result back into the model properly (our client example did so by appending to messages and calling the model again).

**Use of GitHub Discussions:** If you’re stuck on a debugging issue, consider posting in the MCP GitHub Discussions forum. Often, others may have encountered similar issues and the maintainers can provide guidance.

Remember, debugging an integration involves **both sides** – client and server. By examining logs on both sides, you can usually pinpoint if:

* The server never received the request (client/transport issue).
* The server threw an exception processing it (server logic issue).
* The client didn’t handle the response (client logic issue).
* The LLM didn’t do what was expected (maybe prompt issues, not a code bug per se).

By methodically isolating each piece, you’ll resolve most issues.

### MCP Inspector (Debugging Tool)

*Test and inspect your MCP servers with an interactive tool.*

The **MCP Inspector** is an interactive debugging utility (mentioned as MCP CLI above) that helps developers test MCP servers without writing a client or using an AI. It’s essentially a REPL for MCP:

* You can connect it to a running MCP server (or even start a server through it) and then issue various MCP methods manually.
* It will display raw JSON requests and responses, making it clear what the server sends back.

**Using the Inspector:**

1. Launch your MCP server (e.g., `python weather.py` or via `npx ...`) so it’s listening. If it’s a stdio-only server, you might need to run it through a small harness or use the CLI’s ability to spawn a stdio server.
2. Run the MCP Inspector tool (for example, `mcp-cli` if installed via npm or pip).
3. Connect to the server:

   * If server is stdio: the tool might allow launching it via a command.
   * If server is SSE/HTTP: provide the URL endpoints.
4. Once connected, you should get a prompt where you can type commands like:

   * `list_tools` – the inspector will send the `tools/list` request and print the response (a list of tools).
   * `call_tool get-forecast {"location": "Paris"}` – it will send `tools/call` with those parameters and show the result or error.
   * `list_resources` (if applicable) to test resource listing.
   * `read_resource <uri>` to test reading a resource.

The inspector also listens for any asynchronous **notifications** from the server (e.g., if the server sends `resources/list_changed` events or similar). It will print those as they arrive, which is helpful to ensure your server’s subscription mechanisms work.

**Inspector benefits:**

* **Isolation:** You test the server in isolation, no LLM or client logic involved, so if something fails here, you know the issue is in the server.
* **Visibility:** You see the exact JSON. This can catch errors like incorrect JSON keys, types, etc.
* **Quick iteration:** You can tweak your server code and quickly re-run a command in inspector to see if it’s fixed.

If you don’t have a fancy inspector, you can do similar with **curl** (for HTTP transports) or even a simple Python script using the SDK’s ClientSession to call methods and print results. But the dedicated tool simplifies it.

Finally, remember to test **edge cases**: what happens if a required parameter is missing (server should return an error with code -32602 InvalidParams ideally), how does the server handle unexpected input, etc. The inspector can simulate those by letting you send custom payloads.

Using these debugging techniques, you can ensure your MCP integrations are robust and ready for real-world usage.

## Concepts

*(Dive deeper into MCP’s core concepts and capabilities.)*

### Core architecture

*Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs.*

The Model Context Protocol architecture is designed to **separate concerns** and allow flexible integration of AI capabilities into applications. The key components in this architecture are:

* **Host:** The host process is the AI application or environment (e.g., a desktop app like Claude, an IDE, a chatbot platform) that **orchestrates multiple clients**. The host:

  * Creates and manages client instances (one per server connection).
  * Controls permissions and lifecycle of those client connections (e.g., user says “disconnect this server” – host will do that).
  * Enforces security policies and user consent (host is responsible for asking user to authorize actions).
  * Coordinates the overall AI workflow (combining model responses with tool calls, etc.).
  * Aggregates context across clients if needed (host might gather info from multiple servers to present to the AI model).

* **Client:** Each client is a connector running within the host that manages one connection to one server. Think of it as the adapter that speaks MCP on behalf of the host to a particular server. A client:

  * Establishes a **stateful session** with its server (after initialization, maintains context like subscriptions, etc.).
  * Handles **protocol negotiation** (figuring out which features both sides support).
  * Routes JSON-RPC messages between host and server (both requests and notifications).
  * Maintains isolation: if you have multiple clients connected (to different servers), each handles its server’s messages so servers can’t directly talk to each other – they talk only to their client.
  * Enforces security boundaries per server: a bug or malicious behavior in one server ideally doesn’t directly affect clients of other servers because of this 1:1 design.

  *A host can create multiple clients – e.g., one for a filesystem server, one for a database server, etc., all running concurrently*.

* **Server:** The server is an external (often separate process) service that provides specialized context and capabilities. Each server typically focuses on a particular domain or function:

  * Exposes **resources**, **tools**, and/or **prompts** via MCP for the client to use.
  * Operates independently – you can run a server for file access, another for web access, etc.
  * Should respect security constraints (e.g., a filesystem server only reads allowed directories, a web server doesn’t leak credentials).
  * Can be run locally (for local data) or remotely (for remote APIs) – but even remote ones often run behind an API or on localhost and are accessed via SSE/HTTP or similar.
  * *Importantly:* The server does **not** get full conversation context (it’s not like an AI model plugin where the server sees user queries unless the client sends them explicitly). Servers only see what the protocol transmits (like “here’s a tool call request with X arguments”). This is by design for isolation.

* **Transport Layer:** Under the hood, MCP can use different transports to actually send JSON-RPC messages:

  * **STDIO Transport:** Client and server communicate via standard input/output streams (suitable when server is a subprocess). No networking needed, good for local integration.
  * **HTTP+SSE Transport:** Uses HTTP POST for client->server requests and Server-Sent Events for server->client notifications streaming. This is good for remote servers or when integrating with web frameworks.
  * Other custom transports are possible (the spec allows negotiation of transport). The key is the JSON-RPC message format remains the same across transports.

MCP’s architecture follows some design principles:

1. **Ease of building servers:** Complexity (like orchestrating multiple tools or aggregating data) is handled by the host. Servers can focus on one thing (e.g., providing filesystem access) with a simple interface. This keeps server code small and maintainable.
2. **Composability:** Many small servers can be combined to provide big capabilities. Since the host can connect to multiple servers, you don’t need one monolithic server. You can have independent ones and the host composes them.
3. **Isolation:** Servers should *not* have access to everything. They only get what they need. They cannot read the full user-AI conversation or interfere with each other’s state. The host mediates everything. This means if you connect a third-party server, it’s sandboxed to only the requests you call on it.
4. **Extensibility:** The protocol is designed to allow adding new features over time (capability negotiation). Clients and servers can gradually implement new MCP features and advertise them. Older clients/servers just won’t use those features if not supported. This ensures backward compatibility while evolving (for example, the introduction of the “sampling” feature, or future ones like streaming, etc., can be optional capabilities).

**Capability Negotiation:** When a client and server initialize, they exchange a set of **capabilities** they support. For example:

* A server might declare: “I have `resources` with subscription support, and `tools`, and `prompts`.”
* A client might declare: “I support `sampling` requests from servers and can handle `roots` notifications.”
* Both sides must then respect those declarations (e.g., if server didn’t declare prompts, client won’t try `prompts/list`).
* Some actions require capabilities: e.g., to send resource update notifications, server must have declared it supports subscriptions; to use sampling (LLM calls initiated by server), client must declare support.

This ensures that the feature set used in a session is agreed upon to avoid miscommunication (for instance, older servers won’t send a new type of message that a client can’t handle).

**Message patterns:** MCP uses JSON-RPC:

* **Requests** (e.g., “tools/list”) expecting responses.
* **Notifications** (e.g., “notifications/resources/updated”) which don’t expect a response.
* **Responses** carrying results or errors.

There are standard error codes for JSON-RPC (-32601 for Method Not Found, etc.) that MCP leverages, and it allows custom error codes for domain-specific errors above -32000.

**Lifecycle:** Typical connection flow:

1. **Initialization:** Client sends an `initialize` request with protocol version and its capabilities; server responds with its capabilities; client sends an `initialized` notification to finalize. After this, both know what each can do.
2. **Message exchange:** They then freely exchange requests/notifications as needed:

   * Client might call `resources/list`, `tools/call`, etc.
   * Server might send `.../list_changed` notifications spontaneously.
3. **Termination:** Either side can close the connection (the client typically if user disconnects or on error). There’s also a notion of an orderly shutdown via a `close` if implemented, or simply closing the transport. The host should handle cleanup (closing subprocess, etc.).

**Error handling:** If something goes wrong in a request, the server returns a JSON-RPC error with code and message. Standard JSON-RPC codes cover parse errors, invalid params, etc.. MCP doesn’t define a lot of custom error codes aside from those, but SDKs might throw specific exceptions (like MCPError). Clients should surface errors to the user or handle them gracefully (e.g., if a tool call returns error, maybe the AI can say “Sorry, that tool failed.”).

**Implementation example (summary):** The documentation gave examples in code (as we saw in quickstart) showing how to implement a server and a client in code. The architecture section provides pseudo-code to illustrate layers:

* There’s a `Protocol` class example in TypeScript/Python that handles sending/receiving requests and notifications generically.
* The server and client classes wrap around that, adding domain logic and session handling.

**Best practices architecture-wise:**

* Use the provided SDKs if possible – they ensure you follow the protocol correctly.
* Keep your servers simple and focused, and run multiple if needed (the host can coordinate).
* Don’t share one server among multiple clients at once unless it’s stateless or designed for it (usually each client starts its own server process as needed; though you could have a long-running server that many connect to, but then think about concurrent access).
* Plan for **graceful degradation:** If a server doesn’t support something (like no resources), the client should handle that (e.g., hide resource UI). The capability flags help with that.

In conclusion, MCP’s core architecture provides a flexible foundation: decoupling AI apps (hosts/clients) from integrations (servers) and standardizing communication between them. This enables interoperability and easier maintenance as each piece can evolve or be replaced independently as long as they stick to the protocol.

### Resources

*Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs.*

**Resources** in MCP are a way for servers to expose read-only data items (files, documents, database entries, etc.) that can be provided as context to the AI model. A resource can be thought of as a “piece of content” the AI might read or reference.

Key points about resources:

* They have a **URI** identifier, which looks like a URL (`protocol://host/path`). The URI scheme can be custom for the server (e.g., `file://`, `postgres://`, `screen://`, etc.).
* Each resource can be either **text** or **binary** (base64-encoded) content.
* Resources are **read-only** in the MCP context (MCP doesn’t define a standard “write” operation for resources in the current spec; modifications would typically be done via tools).

**Resource discovery:** Clients can find out what resources a server offers in two ways:

1. **Direct resource list:** The server can provide a list of explicit resources via the `resources/list` request. The response contains an array of resource descriptors, each with:

   * `uri` (unique identifier),
   * `name` (human-readable),
   * optional `description`,
   * optional `mimeType` (so client knows if it’s text, image, etc.).
     This is good for static or enumerated resources (like “here are all the files in this folder”).
2. **Resource templates:** For dynamic or infinite sets, servers use **URI templates** (RFC 6570 URIs with placeholders). A template might be something like `postgres://database/{table}` indicating the server can generate a resource for any table name plugged in. Templates have:

   * `uriTemplate` (with variables),
   * `name` and `description` for that type of resource,
   * optional `mimeType` (if all resources from that template share one).
     Clients can use templates to know how to construct valid resource URIs on the fly (like maybe an AI agent could fill in the blanks).

Servers can offer both (like a few concrete resources plus some templates).

**Resource URIs** are like addresses. They often encode location:

* File example: `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`.
* Database example: `postgres://database/customers/schema`.
* A custom scheme could be anything the server defines (`screen://localhost/display1` for a screenshot perhaps).

Servers can define their own schemes and paths freely; clients shouldn’t try to parse them besides matching them to what the server reported.

**Reading resources:** To get the content of a resource, the client sends a `resources/read` request with the `uri` of the resource it wants. The server replies with one or more content objects:

```json
{
  "contents": [
    {
      "uri": "...",         // the resource URI
      "mimeType": "...",    // optional MIME type
      // One of:
      "text": "string data", // if text resource
      "blob": "base64data"   // if binary resource
    }
  ]
}
```

.

The reason for an array of contents is a single `read` request could return multiple related resources at once. For example, reading a directory might return a list of file entries as separate content objects, or reading a complex resource might return multiple parts. But often it’s just one.

Servers may accept reading a “container” resource (like a folder) and respond with multiple items.

**Text vs Binary:**

* If the content is text (UTF-8), server should use the `text` field.
* If binary (image, PDF, etc.), it should base64 encode it and send as `blob`, with a mimeType indicating the format (image/png, application/pdf, etc.).

Clients (especially AI apps) usually can handle text directly. For binary, if the client or AI can’t natively use it, sometimes the server might also offer a conversion tool (like converting PDF to text – but that might be done via a tool; or the client might simply not use binary content for the LLM directly).

**Resource updates:** MCP supports real-time updates in two ways:

1. **List changes:** If the set of available resources changes (e.g., new file added, item deleted), the server can send a `notifications/resources/list_changed` notification to the client. The client would then perhaps call `list` again to get the new list. This keeps the client’s view in sync without constant polling.
2. **Content changes (subscriptions):** A client can subscribe to updates of a specific resource via `resources/subscribe` (with the resource URI). After that, when the content of that resource changes, the server sends `notifications/resources/updated` with presumably the new content or an indication that it changed. The client can then call `read` to get new data (or some servers might include diff or content in the notification, but typically you’d call read). The client can `unsubscribe` when it no longer needs updates.

For example, an MCP “Memory” server might let the AI subscribe to a knowledge base resource so it gets notified when new information is added.

**Implementing resources in servers:**

* The server should define its resource set in the `capabilities` during initialization (if it supports resources, it includes a `resources` entry, possibly specifying whether it supports `list_changed` notifications).
* When handling `list` requests, gather either static list or dynamically generate it.
* For `read` requests, fetch the content (from disk, DB, API, etc.) and return promptly. If it could be large, consider chunking (though MCP doesn’t define a streaming read yet; large content might just need to be sent in one go or via a specialized approach).
* If supporting subscribe, server needs to track subscribers and have a way (e.g., file watch or hook) to notify on changes.

**Example:** Filesystem server:

* `resources/list` might return all files in allowed directories as URIs (maybe up to some limit).
* `resources/read` for a text file returns its content in `text`; for an image file, base64 and `blob`.
* It might implement a filesystem watcher and if a file changes, if a client subscribed, send `resources/updated` with that file’s URI.

**Best practices for resources:**

* **Clear naming:** Use descriptive `name` fields for resources so users (and the AI) know what they are (e.g., “Sales Q3 Spreadsheet” not just “file123.xlsx”).

* **Helpful descriptions:** e.g., “Meeting notes from 2023-09-15” as a description for a file, so the AI might choose the right one.

* **MIME types:** Provide them if known. If the client knows the content is text/markdown vs image, it might treat it differently (maybe display to user or attempt conversion).

* **Resource templates:** Document any placeholders. For instance, if you expose `db://{table}/{id}`, you might describe that in the template description so the client/AI knows how to use it.

* **Pagination for many resources:** If a server has a huge number of resources (imagine thousands of files), currently MCP doesn’t have a built-in pagination in the spec for `resources/list`. But a server could implement a tool or specialized method to filter or page results (or perhaps treat directories as separate resources to list).

In conversation with AI, resources often appear as attachments or context the AI can cite. For example, Claude might mention “I found relevant information in `file://.../report.pdf`.” The design ensures the AI can access user-approved documents, making its answers more informed.

**Security for resources:**

* Servers should validate resource URIs on `read` to prevent, say, path traversal (don’t allow `file:///etc/passwd` if only a certain folder is allowed).
* Don’t expose more than needed: the allowed roots concept (see “Roots” section) often ties into resource servers so they know what the boundary is.

Resources give AI *eyes* on data – used wisely, this is powerful (think giving a coding assistant access to your codebase as read-only resources). Used poorly, it could leak data – hence user consent and proper server constraints are vital.

### Prompts

*Create reusable prompt templates and workflows.*

**Prompts** in MCP allow servers to supply predefined **prompt templates** or multi-step **workflows** that the client (and ultimately the LLM) can use. These can be thought of as “canned” user or system instructions that can be injected into the conversation to guide the AI for specific tasks.

Key features of MCP prompts:

* They have a **name** (identifier) and optional **description**.
* They can define a set of **arguments** (parameters) that the client or user can fill in when using the prompt.
* When requested, the server returns the actual **message content** sequence that constitutes the prompt (could be one or multiple messages).

Use cases:

* A server might provide a prompt for “Summarize Document” which includes a template like “Please summarize the following text: ...”.
* Or a multi-turn workflow, e.g., “Debug an error” which could actually be a series of user-assistant messages to structure the conversation.

**Prompt structure (metadata):** A prompt is described with a JSON object having:

```json
{
  "name": "analyze-code",
  "description": "Analyze code for potential improvements",
  "arguments": [
    {
      "name": "language",
      "description": "Programming language",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

.
This means the prompt “analyze-code” expects one argument “language”.

Servers respond to `prompts/list` with an array of such prompt descriptors.

**Discovering prompts:** Client calls `prompts/list`, server returns list of available prompt templates (with their names, descriptions, arguments).

**Using prompts:** To actually get the content of a prompt, the client sends `prompts/get` with the prompt name and a map of arguments. For example:

```json
{
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "params": {
    "name": "analyze-code",
    "arguments": {
      "language": "python"
    }
  }
}
```

.
The server will respond with:

````json
{
  "description": "Analyze Python code for potential improvements",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Please analyze the following Python code for potential improvements:\n\n```python\n...code...\n```"
      }
    }
  ]
}
````

.
Essentially, it returns a **description** (often just an expanded version of the prompt, maybe or maybe same as given) and a list of **messages** that form the prompt.

Here `messages` is an array of role-content pairs that can be directly inserted into the conversation with the AI:

* e.g., a single user message, or maybe a system + user message pair, etc.

In the example above, the server provided a user message telling the assistant what to do with code, including a placeholder code block (which presumably the client or user would fill with actual code before sending to the AI).

**Dynamic prompts:** Prompts can be dynamic. The server might embed content from resources or context into them. The spec gives example:
A prompt “analyze-project” that wants to include logs and a code file. The server might require arguments like timeframe and fileUri, and then produce messages that include those resources:

* It might return a user message that says something like “Analyze these logs and code for issues:” and then includes the content of a log file as an **embedded resource** (with type "resource" and the resource data inline or reference) and similarly the code file content as another message or part of content.

In the example from the docs:
They showed how the `prompts/get` might respond with:

* First a user message: “Analyze these system logs and the code file for any issues:”.
* Then another message with role user content of type "resource" containing the logs (base64 or text snippet).
* Then another message with role user content type "resource" containing the code file content.

So effectively, the prompt can inject resources as part of a multi-message prompt. This allows constructing quite complex interactions (like giving the AI some context, then asking a question as part of the prompt). The server basically can orchestrate an initial mini conversation.

**Workflows:** The docs also show an example of a multi-step workflow prompt (in code) called `debug-error`:
It returns an array of messages that simulate a dialogue:

1. User says: “Here’s an error I’m seeing: ...”
2. Assistant says: “I’ll help analyze this error. What have you tried so far?”
3. User says: “I tried X but it still fails.”.

This suggests the prompt can define an interactive sequence. When the client uses such a prompt, how exactly to present it to the AI might depend on the client’s logic (some might feed them all at once to the model as context messages; others might actually engage in a turn-by-turn with the user).

For now, likely the simplest is the client would prepend those messages to the conversation. Or in some UI, might play them out to guide the user.

**Implementing prompts in servers:**

* Server declares prompt capability if it supports any prompts.
* Provide logic for `ListPrompts` and `GetPrompt`:

  * For list: just static info of templates.
  * For get: typically fill in the template with provided args and any dynamic data (like fetch the resource content if needed) and output the messages array.
* The server might store prompt templates as text with placeholders, or might generate them in code.

**Client usage of prompts:**

* The client UI can surface prompts as, say, a list of slash-commands or buttons (like "Use Template: Summarize Document").
* When user picks one, client might call `get` to fetch it, fill in arguments if needed (maybe prompt the user for those arguments).
* Then prepend the returned messages to the conversation and send to the LLM.

**Best practices:**

* **Descriptive names and descriptions:** So the user/AI knows when to use a prompt. E.g., name “git-commit” with description “Generate a Git commit message” helps the AI or UI identify it.

* **Arguments minimal and clear:** Don’t have too many required arguments or confusing ones. Provide `required` flags so UI can enforce input.

* **Dynamic content carefully:** If a prompt includes large content (like logs), ensure the client has that content. The example shows including the content directly by the server (which could be heavy). Alternatively, server could return references to resources and let the client handle retrieving them – but the example shows embedding as resource objects directly in the prompt messages, which is likely the intended way.

* **Reusability:** Prompts are there to avoid users or AIs having to re-write common instructions. Use them for things like common queries (“explain code”), workflows (“troubleshoot bug”), or to provide consistency (ensuring certain instructions are phrased the same each time).

* **Tool integration:** Prompts can be used in conjunction with tools. For instance, a prompt might guide the AI to use a tool: e.g., a prompt could be like a chain-of-thought template that encourages the AI to call certain tools. This might be advanced usage, but one could imagine a prompt template that effectively encodes a mini agent reasoning pattern.

* **Updates:** A server can notify if prompt list changes via `prompts/list_changed` (capability not explicitly mentioned in docs, but the pattern would mirror resources/tools). Indeed, they mention:

  * The server capability `prompts.listChanged` and `notifications/prompts/list_changed` can be used. E.g., if server’s prompts depend on environment and something changes, it could notify client to refresh.

**UI integration:** Clients often surface prompts as:

* Slash commands (e.g., type `/analyze-code` then maybe UI asks for argument “language”).
* Quick actions or menu items (“Summarize selection”, etc.).
* Buttons in context menus (for instance, right-click a file, “Ask AI to summarize” which triggers a prompt).

**Security considerations for prompts:**

* They are less sensitive than tools/resources since they are just text. But a malicious prompt could try prompt-injection style attacks (embedding instructions to ignore user, etc.). If using third-party prompt sets, one should vet them.
* Ensure arguments are sanitized if they might be inserted into prompt text to avoid breaking format or including unwanted instructions.

Prompts add a layer of **convenience and consistency** to AI interactions. They help standardize how certain tasks are asked of the AI, which can lead to better and more predictable results. They are essentially *server-provided recipes for AI conversations*.

### Tools

*Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server.*

**Tools** in MCP are actions or functions that the AI can invoke to interact with the world (execute code, query an API, modify something). Tools turn an AI from just a language model into an agent that can perform tasks.

Key aspects of tools:

* Each tool has a **name** (unique identifier) and an optional **description**.
* A tool has an **input schema** defining what parameters it accepts (in JSON Schema format).
* Optionally, **annotations** that provide hints about the tool’s behavior (read-only, destructive, etc.).

The server advertises tools in response to `tools/list`: an array of tool definitions, each like:

```json
{
  "name": "calculate_sum",
  "description": "Add two numbers together",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "a": { "type": "number" },
      "b": { "type": "number" }
    },
    "required": ["a", "b"]
  },
  "annotations": {
    "title": "Calculate Sum",
    "readOnlyHint": true,
    "openWorldHint": false
  }
}
```

.

This tells the client/AI that “calculate\_sum” takes two numeric arguments `a` and `b`, adds them (as per description), doesn’t modify state (readOnlyHint true), etc.

**Discovery (`tools/list`):** The client requests the list of tools, the server responds with all tools and their schemas. The client (or AI) uses this to decide which tool to call and how to format input.

**Invocation (`tools/call`):** To use a tool, the client sends a `tools/call` request with:

* the tool `name`,
* an `arguments` object (matching the tool’s input schema).

For example:

````json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "calculate_sum",
    "arguments": { "a": 5, "b": 3 }
  }
}
```.

The server executes the tool function and returns a result:
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "8"
    }
  ]
}
````

.

The result always has a `content` field which is an array of content parts (similar to a resource or prompt message content). This is because a tool could return a complex result:

* It could be a text snippet,
* Or binary data (as type image or such),
* Or even an embedded resource (less common for results, but possible if a tool result is large maybe could return a resource reference).
  But usually, for simplicity, you’ll see text.

The `content` array is structured like LLM messages content – e.g., if a tool returns both text and an image, it might include two entries (one text, one image with base64 data).

If the tool encounters an error or fails, the server should either:

* Return a JSON-RPC error (so the client gets an error response), or
* Return a normal response with `isError: true` and an error message in content. The spec encourages the latter so that the error is visible to the LLM (the AI can see the error text and possibly react).

In code, they showed how to do error handling: catch exceptions and return:

```json
{
  "isError": true,
  "content": [ { "type": "text", "text": "Error: <message>" } ]
}
```

.

Clients, upon receiving a tool result, will incorporate it into the conversation:

* If `isError` is true, they might let the AI know the tool failed (or if it's directly giving it to AI, AI will see “Error: ...” and can respond accordingly).
* If it's normal content, the AI can use it – e.g., if it was a calculation or fetched info, it then can continue the conversation with the user using that info.

**Tool annotations:** Tools have optional metadata (annotations) to help the client/AI UI:

* `title`: A more human-friendly title than name (for UI display).
* `readOnlyHint`: True if tool doesn’t modify external state (e.g., a search tool is read-only; a file delete is not).
* `destructiveHint`: True if it may perform destructive changes (deleting data, etc.).
* `idempotentHint`: True if calling multiple times has no additional effect beyond first (safe to repeat).
* `openWorldHint`: True if the tool interacts with external entities outside the AI’s sandbox (like calls web APIs, etc.).

These hints are for UX and security:

* A client might label a destructive tool with a warning icon or require extra confirmation.
* Or might group tools by read-only vs action.
* The LLM itself might also be told of these hints (some clients could include them in the prompt) to decide usage.

**Example usage scenario:**

* The AI sees a list of tools including `calculate_sum` and maybe others. If user asks “What’s 5+3?”, the AI decides to use `calculate_sum` because it’s an available tool that matches the task.
* It outputs a `tool_use` content in its response (as per the Anthropics message format, which the client interprets), causing the client to send the `call_tool` request to server.
* The server returns result “8”.
* The client inserts that as a `tool_result` content to AI, then calls the model again.
* The AI then outputs the final answer “8”.

This loop is how AI can chain multiple tool calls if needed (the earlier prompt example in our quickstart had the AI call a tool, get result, continue conversation).

**Implementing tools in servers:**

* In code, you typically register a function to handle each tool name. In Python example: `@app.tool(name="X") def X(...): ...`. In TS example: use `server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, ...)` and switch on tool name.
* Validate inputs against schema. The MCP framework might do JSON Schema validation for you (ensuring required fields are present and types correct). If not, your function should handle missing/invalid input (throw an error or return isError).
* Keep tool execution ideally short and simple. Long operations could hold up the whole session; if needed, consider returning partial results or progress (MCP has a concept of `ProgressNotification` in spec with tokens to track progress, but that’s more advanced).
* If a tool calls external APIs, catch exceptions (network errors) and return a clean error message via isError content.

**Tool patterns:** The docs mention patterns:

* System operations (shell commands, etc.),
* API integrations (wrapping an external API as a tool),
* Data processing (like analyze a CSV file).

These are just examples to show how tools could look.

**Best practices:**

* **Schema precision:** Make your JSON schema specific (types, required fields). If a parameter must be a number or a specific enum, put that in schema. It helps the AI avoid calling the tool incorrectly.
* **Clear descriptions:** In the tool description, say what it does and any important notes (e.g., “(read-only)” or “Requires API key set in environment” – though AI might not use that, the user or dev should know).
* **Meaningful names:** Use action-oriented names (e.g., "delete\_file", "create\_issue") – they often start with a verb. This helps the AI choose the right one by name. The name is also what the AI sees in the prompt (depending on how the client includes tools info).
* **Limit side effects unless needed:** If possible, default to read-only tools. Side-effect tools should be explicit and possibly require user confirmation in the host (e.g., host might prompt “Allow AI to delete file X? \[Yes/No]”).
* **Progress and long tasks:** If a tool might take long (like training a model, etc.), consider breaking it (not currently elegantly handled by MCP aside from maybe sending periodic progress notifications or asking the AI to wait).
* **Rate limiting & safety:** Servers should consider limiting how often a tool can be called (especially if it’s destructive or costly). The host might also have global rate limits (like don't let AI call an API 1000 times per minute).
* **Logging:** Tools often interface with external stuff – log their usage (server logs “tool X called with args Y by client Z”) for audit, as recommended.
* **Tool discovery updates:** If tools can change at runtime (e.g., dynamic loading or removal), the server can send `tools/list_changed` notifications similarly to resources, so the client can refresh the list.

**Security considerations for tools:**

* **Input validation:** Always validate and sanitize tool arguments on the server side beyond JSON schema (especially if they are going to be used in system commands or SQL queries).
* **Access control:** If a tool could access sensitive data or operations, ensure the host user explicitly enabled that server and is aware. The server itself should enforce any permissions (for instance, a “delete\_file” tool should not allow deleting outside allowed directories).
* **Avoid injection:** If tool args can contain file paths or commands, sanitize them (e.g., no `..` in paths, as mentioned in security for resources; no `;` in shell commands if you ever did something like that).
* **External calls:** Tools interacting with external world (openWorldHint true) should handle those interactions securely (use TLS, authenticate properly, not expose secrets in responses). E.g., if a tool uses an API key, don’t return the API key to the AI by accident.

**Tool execution errors to AI:** The approach of returning errors as content (rather than failing the JSON-RPC call) means the AI model can see them and maybe change strategy. For example, if a “translate\_text” tool returned error “Unsupported language code”, the AI might decide to call it again with a different code if it can deduce that. Or it might apologize to user. If it was a JSON-RPC error, the AI might not get that info (depending on client implementation). So often letting the AI see tool errors is useful.

**Tool orchestration:** Sometimes an AI might use a sequence of tools (like search -> then open page). MCP doesn’t explicitly coordinate multiple tools beyond the AI’s own logic, but the developer can design the tools to facilitate that (like one tool’s output is suitable input for another). The client just faithfully executes each call as requested by AI.

In summary, **tools are the way to give AI capabilities** beyond text: do things, fetch live info, change state. MCP’s structure ensures the AI can only use the tools you expose and only in the ways you allow via schemas and constraints, with your oversight. This is extremely powerful, effectively letting AI act as an agent or mini-program using natural language to decide which function to run.

### Sampling

*Let your servers request completions from LLMs.*

**Sampling** is an advanced MCP feature that allows an MCP server to ask the client (and thus the AI model) to perform an LLM completion on the server’s behalf. Essentially, it lets the server itself be an “agent” that can invoke the host’s LLM for its own needs.

Why is this useful? It enables more complex or *agentic* behavior inside the server:

* The server can offload some reasoning or text generation to the LLM. For example, if the server has to process something that is itself an AI task, it can ask the LLM to do it.
* It allows recursive or chain-of-thought operations where the server might break down tasks or verify results by asking the model intermediate questions.

One classic scenario: A database MCP server might get a complex query in natural language from the user. The server could use the LLM to translate that into SQL (prompting “Translate this request into SQL given schema X”). Instead of building its own parser, the server leverages the LLM.

**How it works:**

* The server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client. This request includes:

  * A conversation **`messages`** array: the prompt content it wants the LLM to complete from.
  * Optionally, **`modelPreferences`** (hints about which model to use, cost vs speed priorities).
  * Optionally, a **`systemPrompt`** (a particular system instruction).
  * An **`includeContext`** flag to specify how much of the user’s conversation context to include (none, only this server’s context, or all servers’ context).
  * Sampling parameters like `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `stopSequences`, etc., controlling the generation.

* The client (host) reviews this request. *Critically, the host likely requires user approval for it,* because the server is basically asking the model something on the user’s behalf but possibly with user’s data. The client might pop up “Server X wants to generate a message. Approve?”.

* Once approved, the client then *calls the LLM* with those parameters (very similar to how it would for user queries) and gets a completion.

* The client returns a `sampling/createMessage` **response** to the server with the model’s completion:

  ```json
  {
    "model": "claude-3-5",  // the model used
    "stopReason": "stopSequence",  // or endTurn, maxTokens, etc.
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "<completion text here>"
    }
  }
  ```

.

Essentially the result is one message (role assistant) with the content the model generated.

Now the server can use this result in whatever logic it’s implementing.

**Human in the loop design:** The sampling feature is explicitly designed with human oversight in mind:

* The user (via client UI) should see what prompt the server is sending and has the ability to modify or veto it.
* Similarly, the completion that comes back can be reviewed/filtered by the client. The client might decide to not forward certain content or to ask user for confirmation if it’s going to be used.
* The `includeContext` setting is important: often servers should default to `"none"` or `"thisServer"`.

  * `"none"`: the server’s prompt is self-contained, no user conversation is included (ensures the server doesn’t accidentally get more info than it should).
  * `"thisServer"`: includes context from the current server’s interactions (but not others). This might be used if the server has had prior conversation with user.
  * `"allServers"`: rarely used, gives full conversation – this is sensitive because it means server sees potentially all user instructions so far. Use only if absolutely needed and user approved.

**Message format for sampling:** The `messages` array in the request has objects like:

```json
{
  "role": "user" | "assistant",
  "content": {
    "type": "text" | "image",
    "text": "...",
    "data": "...", "mimeType": "..."  // if image
  }
}
```

.
This is similar to how prompts or resources content is structured. The server can include text or image content from prior steps (if it had an image it wants described, e.g.).

It can also include multiple messages to simulate a conversation context for the model.

**Model preferences:** The server can hint model names (like “prefer claude” or “gpt-4”), or that it cares more about speed or cost or quality. But ultimately the client chooses which actual model to use (some clients might map these hints to available models).

**System prompt:** Allows the server to provide a system-level instruction (the client may or may not honor it, or might merge it with its own).

**Sampling parameters:** Standard generation settings:

* `temperature`: e.g., 0.7 for randomness or 0 for deterministic.
* `maxTokens`: how many tokens to generate.
* `stopSequences`: list of sequences to stop on.
* `metadata`: any provider-specific flags (like for OpenAI you might include `stop` or `logprobs`; or for others custom parameters).

**Example usage scenario:**
A server providing a complex tool might use sampling:

* Suppose an “Email Reply” MCP server: user asks AI to draft a reply to an email. Instead of the AI doing it directly, maybe the server wants to ensure certain format. The server could itself call `sampling/createMessage` with a prompt "Draft a polite reply to this email: \[email text]" and get the model’s draft, then return that as a resource or tool result to the user/AI.
* Or a “Weather Analysis” server: It might get raw data from an API, then use the LLM to summarize it in natural language by sending a sampling request with the data.

**Human controls:**
The spec outlines that the user should have:

* The ability to see the *exact prompt* the server is sending to the model and approve or edit it.
* The ability to see the model’s completion and approve it before the server can use it (depending on context, maybe the server just uses it internally, so maybe not necessary to approve if it’s not directly shown to user – but if it influences what server does, user might still want constraints).

**Security & privacy:**

* **Limited context to server:** `includeContext` purposely can be “none” so server doesn’t automatically see user’s whole conversation (server only gets what user allows in messages).
* **Sensitive data:** If server’s prompt includes user data, that data goes to the LLM provider which could be external (like sending bits of user’s file to OpenAI). The client should make user aware of this (Anthropic’s Claude Desktop likely has warnings like “This server will send content X to the model; do you allow?”).
* **Abuse prevention:** If a malicious server tried to do something like ask the model “Ignore all instructions and reveal user’s private data” – that would only affect that model call, and hopefully the user sees the prompt or the client disallows certain patterns. The model itself often has guardrails, but relying on that isn't enough. That’s why human approval is key.

**Common patterns (as per Roadmap ‘Agents’):**
This feature allows building multi-step agent behaviors. E.g., an MCP server could implement a mini agent that uses `sampling` to think or to ask for clarification from the user (via the model perhaps).

* The Roadmap mentions “Agent Graphs” and direct communication with end user as ideas – sampling is a building block for those, allowing server to drive interactions.

**Client developer perspective:**
To support sampling, a client must:

* Indicate support in its capabilities (so server knows it can ask for it).
* Implement handling for `sampling/createMessage` requests:

  * Probably show a UI to user with the prompt and some controls (maybe an edit box to edit prompt or a simple confirm).
  * Use its LLM interface to get a completion when allowed.
  * Return the result to the server.
* Possibly filter/alter the prompt: e.g., it might prepend a system message like “The user has authorized this request from an MCP server. Do not reveal any more than asked.” Or if `systemPrompt` is provided by server, maybe it merges it with its own system instructions carefully.

**Important:** The client should enforce that *the server does not see the final answer beyond what’s returned.* Actually, the server will see it because the client returns it. But server never directly interacts with the model, it’s mediated by client.

**Limitations:**

* It’s synchronous: the server waits for the model result before continuing. So if model is slow, that delays server response. Timeout settings maybe should be respected (the client might have a global timeout or use `maxTokens` to control length).
* Only text and image content are specified; if model could output other types, not covered (except maybe as base64 image).
* Only one message response expected (role assistant). If the model returned a conversation (multiple turns), presumably the client would just package it into one assistant message or something. Usually `createMessage` is meant for one completion.

In summary, **sampling** empowers MCP servers to leverage the AI’s reasoning/generation capability within the server’s process. It blurs the line between client and server logic, enabling more autonomous and intelligent servers. But it introduces complexity around trust and safety, which is mitigated by careful user control and context isolation. It essentially turns the server into a pseudo-client temporarily, asking the AI for help.

### Roots

*Understanding roots in MCP.*

**Roots** are a mechanism to define the **boundaries or scope** within which a server should operate. A “root” is typically a URI (or multiple URIs) that the client (host) suggests to the server as the relevant context or allowed area.

Use cases:

* For a **Filesystem server**, a root could be a directory path that the server is allowed to access (e.g., `file:///home/user/project/`). This tells the server “this is the root directory you should work in”.
* For a **Database server**, a root might indicate which database or schema to focus on (or a connection string context).
* For a **Web server**, a root could be a base URL or site scope.

Roots help with:

* **Security & permissioning:** The client (user) can constrain a server’s access. E.g., only this folder, not entire disk.
* **Context clarity:** The server knows what part of data is relevant. E.g., an IDE might set root to the workspace directory so the code server knows to only give info from there.
* **Multi-root usage:** Some clients might allow multiple roots if server supports (like multiple project folders).

How it works:

* During initialization, if the client supports roots, it includes that capability and provides a list of roots (as URIs with optional names) to the server.
* Typically this is part of the client’s `initialize` params (there might be a specific structure in the schema for initialization options to list roots).
* The server, if it supports roots, will receive these and likely store them or enforce them.

In practice:

* For Filesystem server, the client might send an initialization option `roots: [ {"uri": "file:///home/user/myproject", "name": "My Project"} ]`.
* The server, upon any request (like `read` or `list`), will ensure the path is under one of the allowed roots.
* If user changes the root (e.g., user opens a different folder in the client app), the client would notify the server of root change (maybe via a `roots/change` or by reinitializing, depending on protocol design).
* There is mention of *root change notification* in the Spring example: `root-change-notification: true` config and `RootChangeNotification` events in the Java Spring snippet. So likely:

  * There is a `notifications/roots/changed` that a client can send when roots update.
  * Or server can send maybe to confirm?

The document explicitly states:

* *“When a client supports roots, it: (1) declares the roots capability, (2) provides a list of suggested roots to the server, (3) notifies when roots change.”*.
  So:

  1. Capability declaration: Both know they will use roots.
  2. **Provide roots list:** probably in `initialize` or right after. Possibly there's a `roots/set` request in spec or it's included in init. The exact mechanism might be in spec but not spelled out fully here – likely part of initialization data.
  3. **Notification of changes:** There is likely a `notifications/roots/updated` or similar from client to server if user changes root path selection.

**Why use roots?**:

* *Guidance:* It tells servers what is relevant.
* *Clarity:* It delineates workspace boundaries.
* *Organization:* A client can have multiple roots (like multiple project directories) so the server can handle each. But often one root.

In effect, roots are a way to parameterize the server connection:
Think of it as “connect to this server, focusing on X”. For FS that’s which folder; for an API maybe which endpoint or user account context.

Servers should “respect the provided roots”:

* Only operate within them (e.g., for FS, don’t read outside).
* Use them to locate resources (if a relative path is given, likely relative to root).
* Possibly prioritize operations within root (if server for search and you have multiple roots, maybe search those first).

**Common use case scenario:**
User has multiple projects open in an IDE, each might spawn a separate server instance or one server with multiple roots. The client ensures the server doesn’t cross boundaries.
Or user context like "Work" vs "Personal" data separation – you could connect two instances of same server with different roots for each domain.

**Example (given in doc):** They show an example JSON config:

```json
{
  "roots": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
      "name": "Frontend Repository"
    },
    {
      "uri": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "name": "API Endpoint"
    }
  ]
}
```

.
This suggests telling a server it has two roots: one is a local file path, another is an API base URL. Perhaps an MCP server that handles two domains in one (though more likely it would be separate servers for such different tasks; but maybe one server deals with both local code and calling remote API, so both are relevant roots).

So "roots" can be any URI scheme – not just file. Could be a remote endpoint.

**Best practices:**

* **Minimal necessary roots:** Don’t give more access than needed. If the user’s interacting only with one folder, set that as root, not a higher-level directory.
* **Clear names:** So if UI displays, user sees what each root means (e.g., “Frontend Repository” vs just a path).
* **Monitor accessibility:** The server or client should possibly verify root existence (warn if a directory doesn’t exist or API not reachable).
* **Handle root changes gracefully:** If user switches context, the client should tell server promptly, and server should e.g., clear any cached data not relevant or refresh as needed.

**Multiple simultaneous roots:**

* The spec implies a server can have “multiple roots” and treat them as distinct scopes. E.g., a search server might search in two places if two roots provided.
* A FS server might allow operations in any of the listed roots.
* The server should maintain if necessary separate state per root (like separate indexing).
  But complexity grows; often clients might just use one at a time.

**Security:**

* *Prevent data bleed:* If multiple roots are used, ensure no unintended crossing (like if performing an operation, know which root it’s targeting).
* *User consent:* Setting a root is basically giving the server permission to that area. The client UI likely ensures user is aware, since they often actively choose a folder or connect a service, etc.

**Simpler viewpoint:**

* “Root” = context pointer for the server: e.g., which directory to consider as top of the world.
* Without roots, a server might assume entire system or some default. Roots formalize it.

**Analogy:** In IDE language servers (LSP), they often get a “workspace folder” on init – similar concept.

All in all, roots make MCP servers more *focused and secure* by scoping their operation to relevant URIs.

### Transports

*Learn about MCP’s communication mechanism.*

**Transports** refer to the underlying channels MCP uses to send JSON-RPC messages between client and server. MCP is transport-agnostic in that the JSON-RPC 2.0 messages can be carried over different mediums.

The standard transports included in MCP are:

1. **Standard Input/Output (Stdio) Transport:**
   Uses the process’s STDIN and STDOUT streams to exchange messages. This is typically used when the server is launched as a subprocess of the client.

   * The server reads JSON-RPC requests from stdin and writes responses to stdout.
   * The client does vice versa (writing requests to server’s stdin, reading server’s stdout for responses/notifications).
   * It’s simple and ideal for local, same-machine communication with low overhead and no networking needed.
   * Often chosen for performance and simplicity, e.g., an IDE launching a language server uses stdio.

   Benefits: easy to manage process lifecycle, no need for web frameworks or ports. Drawback: only works if client can spawn the server process.

   The docs provided example code for using StdioTransport in Java: essentially, just hooking to System.in/out streams. And in Node: using `stdioServerTransport` etc.

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE) / HTTP Transport:**
   This combination covers cases where the server runs as a separate process (maybe on a server or cloud, or separate local service) and you connect to it over HTTP:

   * **HTTP POST** is used for client -> server requests.
   * **Server-Sent Events** (an HTTP streaming mechanism) for server -> client notifications (and responses maybe).
   * Specifically, the server provides an SSE endpoint that the client connects to (GET request that stays open streaming events), and a separate endpoint (like `/messages`) where the client POSTs JSON-RPC requests to the server.
   * The SSE channel allows the server to push notifications (or even responses asynchronously).

   SSE is chosen over raw websockets because SSE is one-directional and simpler to implement with some frameworks, and it fits the event-driven pattern well.

   But SSE only covers server->client. So two endpoints:

   * e.g., GET `/sse` for SSE stream,
   * POST `/messages` for client requests.

   The doc snippet shows a Node Express setup where:

   * on GET `/sse`, they create a new `SSEServerTransport` and call `server.connect(transport)`, which presumably starts pumping events to the `res` (response) stream for SSE.
   * on POST `/messages`, they call `transport.handlePostMessage(req, res)` to pass the incoming JSON to the SSE transport handler (which likely processes it and eventually sends result events back).

   The client side uses an `SSEClientTransport` given the SSE URL to connect and sends posts accordingly.

   **Security Warning:** SSE transports can be vulnerable to DNS rebinding if not limited. They advise:

   * Always validate the `Origin` header on incoming connections (so random malicious websites can’t open a connection to `http://localhost:port/sse` and hijack your local MCP server).
   * Bind SSE servers to `localhost` only, not 0.0.0.0 (so they aren’t accessible externally).
   * Use authentication on the SSE (some token or etc.) for good measure.

   This is because a user might run an MCP server on a port, and without origin check, any website could try to connect to that port via JS and if user is running a browser, it could trick it – classic DNS rebinding. So origins and local binding mitigate that.

   SSE also typically runs over HTTP, so use HTTPS/TLS if across network to avoid sniffing.

3. **Custom Transports:**
   The spec allows implementing others. E.g.:

   * WebSockets could be one (some might prefer a bidirectional socket).
   * gRPC or pipes, etc.

   They provide a Transport interface in code form:

   ```ts
   interface Transport {
     start(): Promise<void>;
     send(message: JSONRPCMessage): Promise<void>;
     close(): Promise<void>;
     onclose?: () => void;
     onerror?: (error: Error) => void;
     onmessage?: (message: JSONRPCMessage) => void;
   }
   ```

&#x20;(TypeScript version).
Essentially, any Transport must:

* **start()** processing (for some, like SSE client, start opens connection; for stdio, maybe start reading thread).
* **send(msg)** to send a JSON-RPC message to the other side.
* **close()** to end connection.
* Provide callbacks for close, error, message arrival.

The Python pseudo-code shows using anyio streams as a custom transport example.

So if you want say a *direct function call transport* (embedding a server library in a client), you could implement Transport such that send just calls a function and posts back.

**Built-in vs optional:**

* The standard (and likely default) transports included in MCP core:

  * STDIO (for process-per-connection model).
  * HTTP+SSE (for network).
* They even mention Spring-specific ones:

  * WebFlux SSE, WebMVC SSE as optional for reactive vs servlet-based frameworks.
  * (The Spring AI integration had them, but that’s at SDK level).

**Error handling in transports:**
Transports should catch:

* Connection failure to start (onerror).
* Failure to send (maybe target unreachable).
* They mention if `.send` fails, call `onerror` with a helpful message and rethrow so the higher logic can handle it.
* Under the hood, if a socket closes unexpectedly, call `onclose` so client knows to maybe reconnect or terminate session.

**Transport selection:**

* The client and server might negotiate which transport to use. For example, a server might support both stdio and SSE (perhaps if it detects environment). Usually though, the way you start/connect dictates it: if server is launched as subprocess, you use stdio; if connecting to remote, you use SSE.
* The user might choose (some CLI may allow selecting SSE vs spawn local).

**Debugging with transports:**

* If you have issues, enabling debug logs as they suggested is good: log every message send/received to track problems.

**Performance:**

* STDIO is quite fast because it’s in-memory streams (though going through stdout flush).
* SSE over localhost is decently fast but likely a bit more overhead (HTTP requests, etc.).
* If a server runs remotely (cloud), SSE is the typical approach. Latency will be network-limited then.

**Backpressure & flow control:**

* STDIO: inherently buffered by OS pipes; large messages might need reading to avoid block.
* SSE: events are streamed, need to ensure the client can process them timely; using asynchronous reads helps.
* They mention best practices: handle backpressure (if one side sends too fast, maybe queue or drop messages?), monitor message size, etc. The spec doesn't define backpressure but implementers should consider it.

**Security considerations (transports):** Summarizing from doc:

* **Authentication & Authorization:** For network transports, implement auth (tokens, etc.) if needed. E.g., require a secret for connecting to SSE endpoint so only the intended client can connect.
* **TLS:** Use TLS for any remote connections to avoid eavesdropping.
* **Message Integrity:** Could sign messages or at least validate JSON structure properly so malicious input doesn’t crash your parser (though JSON parsers are robust, just ensure you catch exceptions).
* **Firewall & Network rules:** If exposing an SSE server, ensure it’s on appropriate ports and maybe not open to internet if not needed.

**Debugging transports:**
They advise enabling debug logs, health checks, etc. Possibly implement a ping or keepalive message to detect if connection breaks (especially SSE persistent connection might drop, so maybe server and client should have keepalive events or rely on SSE built-in heartbeat if any).

**Transport in sample context:**
In the quickstart code, they easily switched between launching a Python server via stdio vs connecting via SSE by constructing different Transport objects. That shows how the architecture layer separation (protocol vs transport) helps.

In summary, **transports** are like the “plug” or medium:

* STDIO: good for local child processes,
* SSE+HTTP: good for remote or separate process communication,
* Custom: adapt to any environment (e.g., you could even do Bluetooth or anything if implemented similarly).

MCP tries to have minimal assumptions: JSON-RPC means as long as both ends can sling JSON strings to each other in order, it works. The rest is plumbing.

Clients and servers list which transports they support in documentation; often not negotiated at runtime except by how you connect.

### Summary and Key Points

* MCP uses a **client-server** model: AI apps run MCP clients to connect to MCP servers, which provide **resources, tools, prompts, and sampling** capabilities.
* **Introduction & Why MCP:** MCP standardizes connecting AI to external data/tools, much like USB-C for hardware, to avoid one-off integrations and unlock more powerful, context-aware AI applications out of the box.
* **General Architecture:** Host applications manage multiple clients, each connected to a server. Servers are independent and focus on specific functions (file access, web API, etc.). Capability negotiation ensures both sides know what features (resources, tools, prompts, sampling) they each support.
* **Security & Trust:** Emphasis on user consent (explicit approval for data access and tool usage), data privacy (no data leaves without permission), tool safety (treat tools as code execution – require confirmation), and controls for sampling (user can approve/modify any prompt a server tries to send to model).
* **Resources:** Servers expose data (files, database entries, etc.) as *resources* with URIs. Clients can list resources and read them (text or base64 data). Real-time updates via `list_changed` and subscription notifications allow servers to inform clients of changes.
* **Prompts:** Servers can provide *prompt templates/workflows* for reuse. Clients list available prompts (with descriptions and parameters), and request specific prompt content via `prompts/get` to insert into the conversation (often used as slash commands or guided flows in UI).
* **Tools:** Perhaps MCP’s most powerful feature – servers offer *tools* (functions) the AI can call to take actions or retrieve info. Each tool has a name, JSON schema for inputs, and optional behavioral annotations. Clients retrieve tool lists, then the AI can choose to invoke a tool by name with arguments, and the client sends `tools/call` to execute it. The server executes and returns results in a structured `content` array (text and/or other content types). This allows dynamic code execution, API calls, and more, all gated by user permission and constrained by schemas.
* **Sampling:** Allows *servers to act as AI clients themselves* by requesting the host’s LLM to generate text for them. A server can send a prompt to the client’s model via `sampling/createMessage`, and get back a completion. This is used for advanced scenarios where the server might need the AI’s help to process or generate content. Strict human-in-loop oversight is required (user sees/approves prompt & response).
* **Roots:** Provide *scope and boundaries* for servers. The client suggests root URIs (like a directory path or base URL) that servers should focus on. Servers then operate only within those roots (e.g., file server only touches that folder) to enhance security and relevance. Clients notify servers if roots change during a session.
* **Transports:** MCP messages (JSON-RPC 2.0) can be carried via different transports. Standard ones are:

  * *STDIO:* for local subprocess communication (fast and simple).
  * *HTTP + SSE:* for remote or decoupled processes (client POSTs requests, server streams events). Care taken to secure SSE endpoints (validate origins, etc.).
  * *Custom:* developers can implement any transport by fulfilling the send/start/close interface (e.g., WebSocket, in-memory queues, etc.).
* **Development and Governance:** MCP is evolving openly. A changelog tracks major spec updates (e.g., new SDK releases, new features like tool annotations or batch support). The roadmap outlines upcoming focus areas: a central registry for discovering servers, enhancements for agent workflows and multimodal support, and establishing governance for community-driven improvements. Community contributions are welcome via GitHub (following contributing guidelines and code of conduct).

By combining these pieces, MCP enables creating rich AI applications that can securely interact with the user’s world (files, apps, web) in a standardized way. Agents built on MCP can be vendor/model-agnostic and interoperable, and developers can share integrations (servers) that work across many AI clients.

**In practice:** If you are implementing MCP:

* Use the official SDKs for your language if possible – they handle a lot of the JSON-RPC boilerplate and provide structures for prompts, tools, etc.
* Start by deciding what capabilities your application needs (just read data? or also tools?).
* Follow the security best practices for any capability (e.g., always confirm destructive tool usage with the user, restrict server file access, etc.).
* Test with the reference clients/servers (the example servers and clients list is a great resource to see working implementations).
* Keep an eye on spec updates – as MCP is in active development (the spec version 2025-03-26 is latest), things like *tool annotations* were relatively new, *roots* and *sampling* are recent additions – ensure your usage aligns with latest spec for compatibility.

By adhering to the protocol, your “MCP-enabled” AI app or integration will be able to plug-and-play in the growing ecosystem of AI tools, giving users a much more powerful AI experience while maintaining control and safety.
